This document offers a clear, detailed overview of where Sunrise Systems currently stands, what we’re aiming to become, and what challenges or opportunities lie ahead. It’s written to help guide your brand strategy recommendations as our external branding partner.

### **Where We Are Now**

Sunrise Systems is a fast-growing, founder-led agency focused on helping commercial construction companies scale with better marketing, sales systems, and custom software. Founded in Summer 2024 and fully bootstrapped, we’ve grown from $3K MRR in January 2025 to around $29K MRR by August. Our top client pays $15K/month and is looking to add even more services. The opportunity exists to push this to a $25K/month standard.

We’ve recently begun splitting into three semi-independent business units — Marketing, Sales, and Software Development — and we’re building custom internal software tools to run each service with precision and scale.

We’ve had some growing pains around hiring, operations, and fulfillment quality. Our leadership is actively transitioning from “doing” to “leading,” and we’re moving away from low-budget clients to focus on larger, more established GCs and subcontractors.

### **What We're Struggling With**

* **Positioning & Packaging:** We’re offering a wide variety of services, but haven’t yet consolidated them into one or two clear, irresistible offers that higher-revenue clients immediately understand and value.  
* **Brand Perception:** Our current brand doesn’t reflect the quality of our thinking, design, or systems. We look like a good boutique agency, not like a category-defining partner.  
* **Pricing Confidence:** We’ve delivered $5–15K/month outcomes and some early $25K/month engagements, but haven’t yet crystallized a go-to-market strategy around premium pricing.  
* **Sales Narrative:** For larger companies, we’re still figuring out what pain points resonate most — and how to reposition what we do in a way that breaks through "we're fine as-is" inertia.  
* Multiple half-developed offers (e.g. Sales Management as a service)  
* Quality control across departments  
* SOPs and internal documentation still in progress

### **What We’re Trying to Achieve with the Rebrand**

* **Clear, Premium Positioning:** A new brand identity and messaging that reflects the high-leverage transformation we provide, especially for companies doing $10MM–$50MM+ in revenue.  
* **Category Ownership:** We want to own a distinct space — the only growth partner combining high-quality and effective sales, marketing, and software into a single integrated system for commercial construction.  
* **Packaging & Narrative Clarity:** The brand should make it easy to productize our offers into a few clear packages with premium price points and high perceived value.  
* **Visual and Verbal Authority:** From naming and voice to design and site structure, the new brand should convey confidence, intelligence, and clarity — more "McKinsey x Apple" than "scrappy startup".

### **Service Offering**

* CRM & Sales System Management  
* Newsletter & LinkedIn Content  
* SEO & Search Visibility

Clients can subscribe to recurring services (retainer-based) or one-time projects. However, this a la carte approach is being reevaluated as we consider moving to a more bundled, strategy-first, “Growth Stack” service model.

### **Who Our Customer Is Now**

Right now, our clients tend to be:

* Small to midsize commercial construction companies ($2–10MM revenue)  
* Often GCs or subcontractors (electricians, drywall, etc.)  
* Led by hands-on founders who are stretched thin  
* Struggling with outdated systems, weak branding, and inconsistent lead flow  
* Open-minded and eager to grow, but still in the weeds  
* Willing to invest \~$2,500–$12,000/month across marketing, sales, and software

They’re ideal for building case studies and refining our systems. But they can’t always afford full-scale implementation or strategic consulting. They’re hiring us to get unstuck and win more bids — not necessarily to rethink their entire operation.

---

### **Who Our Ideal Customer Is (for $25K/month+)**

We’re now aiming for larger, more mature construction companies that:

* Do $20MM–$100MM+ in annual revenue  
* Are still founder-led but supported by real teams (marketing, ops, estimating, etc.)  
* Have strong reputations and existing project pipelines, but want more control  
* Are facing margin pressure, inefficient ops, or a desire to scale profitably  
* Already use systems like Procore, Sage, or Monday.com, but feel fragmented  
* Are ready to modernize their brand, unify their systems, and think long-term

These buyers care less about short-term lead gen and more about clarity, control, and strategic growth. They want to:

* Professionalize their brand to attract higher-tier clients and talent  
* Build a better system for marketing, sales, and internal operations  
* Get clarity into performance, pipeline, and margin across departments  
* Move from heroic effort to operational leverage

They can afford $25,000+/month because we’re solving expensive, systemic problems — not just marketing. But to win their trust, our brand needs to feel like a trusted advisor, not a vendor. Premium, strategic, experienced, and aligned with how they already think.

### **Where We’re Going**

We’re rebranding to move from “scrappy construction marketing agency” → to “world-class growth partner” for modern construction firms.

Our north star:

* Become the go-to partner for construction companies that want to modernize  
* Package up branding, marketing, sales, and software into premium service tiers  
* Land $25K–$50K/month retainer clients with a long-term horizon  
* Build a systematized, scalable, productized agency that can reach $500K MRR and beyond

We’re looking to our branding partner to help:

* Sharpen our visual identity  
* Elevate our positioning to enterprise-grade  
* Create clarity and cohesion across our offers  
* Align our external presence with our internal capabilities  
* Make our value prop impossible to ignore for 8–9 figure construction companies

Another big reason for this rebrand is to **simplify**.

Right now we have too many service lines, too much complexity, and too many internal tools for someone on the outside to easily grasp what we do and why it matters. Even internally, it’s making it harder to prioritize, align, and sell clearly.

This rebrand is our opportunity to step back and say: *What are we really here to do?* And then build a brand around that.

We want to make it crystal clear:

* Who we help  
* What we do for them  
* Why we’re the only partner they need

And we want to look, sound, and operate like a world-class firm that’s ready to work with top-tier clients at a serious price point.

For naming, we’ve been looking into names like **Component**, **Factor,** and **Basis**. However, our positioning at this stage was a bit different (more AI-automated marketing/sales/software ops, less strategic consulting). We were leaning towards Component, but after lukewarm reception from clients (and internally) we decided to hold off and look at other options. We have a list of about 50 words that have similar vibes, but most are not serious name contenders.
