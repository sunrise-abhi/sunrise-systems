**Sunrise Systems | October 2025** 

|  | Market | Audience | Competitors |
| :---- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Key Insight \#1** | **Adaptability is the edge**: Smaller firms win through agility, but crossing $50M requires evolving into a more mature, system-driven organization. | **Growth is identity, not scale:** Crossing $50M means shifting from “local builder” to “institutional partner,” backed by systems, credibility, and a story that matches the opportunity. | **Competitors compete on emotion, not just execution.** Whether it’s software, sales, or marketing, they win by making clients feel safe from risk, in control of chaos, and confident in their future. Few do this across all fronts. |
| **Key Insight \#2** | **Credibility is the currency**: At scale, success hinges on proving reliability, managing risk, and earning client trust. | **Trust is the currency:** Mid-sized GCs win not on size or price, but on being the most reliable, accountable, and fair partner. | **Proof is the real product.** In a crowded space, every claim needs a receipt: ROI calculators, dashboards, case studies, guarantees. The winners aren’t just the most capable; they’re the most convincingly proven. |
| **Key Insight \#3** | **Transformation is the journey:** Growth is less about adding projects and more about redefining identity from local builder to institutional partner. | **Culture is the lever:** With labor tight, success comes from retention and loyalty, making the firm a place people want to stay. | **Emotion is the differentiator disguised as logic.** Even in a rational category, the firms that grow fastest are the ones that make clients feel understood, proud, or protected .. using rational tools (data, tech, process) to deliver emotional payoff. |
| **Core Values** | Adaptability, Credibility, Discipline | Trust, Reliability, Loyalty | Proof, Protection, Confidence |

**Hidden Truth**  
**The cracks aren’t in the concrete. They’re in the connections.** Construction doesn’t fail at the slab, it fails in the gaps between people, systems, and pride. Fragmented processes, adversarial contracts, and legacy thinking mean the industry struggles to deliver the certainty it sells.

**Insight**   
**Clients don’t just buy buildings. They buy confidence.** A structure only feels solid when it rests on loyalty, reliability, and trust. Winning firms aren’t just building projects they’re building cultures, systems, and relationships that make every promise stand up.

**Sunrise Advantage**  
**We make confidence the foundation.** While others defend against risk, Sunrise redefines what strength looks like in this business. We help firms build the resilience to flex without breaking, the relationships that turn crews and clients into loyal partners, and the proof that transforms promises into trust.

**Manifesto**  
The cracks in construction aren’t in the concrete. They’re in the way this business runs.

Too many silos. Too much pride. Not enough systems that actually work. And everyone shrugs it off as “just the way it is.”

We don’t buy that.

Builders don’t just make structures, they make promises. And those promises only stand if the people, the culture, and the systems behind them do too.

That’s why we’re here. To make confidence the real foundation. To turn trust into something operational. To make growth less about luck and more about design.

Sunrise is for the builders who want out of the feast-famine cycle. The ones done with guessing games and one-size-fits-none software. The ones who know they’re capable of more, but need a better engine to get there.

We’re not an agency. Not a vendor. Not just another tool. We’re your growth architects. And we deliver certainty in an uncertain business.

**Sunrise Core Values**

1. Credibility \= Do what we say, prove what we do.  
* Talk is cheap in this industry. Proof is the real currency. We show receipts early and often (from dashboards to deliverables) because trust without evidence is just a story.

2. Discipline \= Simple plans, relentless follow-through.  
* Construction punishes overcomplication. So does growth. We cut clutter, commit to the plan, and execute cleanly .. again and again.

3. Adaptability \= Build for change, not for comfort.  
* Markets shift. Tech evolves. Projects stall. We design systems that flex without breaking, so our clients don’t just survive disruption — they profit from it..

4. Loyalty \= Long-term over short-term.  
* We bet on people, not transactions. Clients, subs, team \- we play the long game. Because relationships compound faster than revenue (and pay bigger dividends).

5. Clarity \= No spin, no fog, no guesswork.  
* We keep it visible and plainspoken. Data you can see. Language you can trust. A path that’s obvious, not opaque.

**Brand Voice Traits**   
**Optimistic Challenger**: Future-forward, but not naïve. We question the old ways and show better ones.

**Sharp & Plainspoken**: Short sentences. Punchy rhythm. Industry terms only when they matter.

**Human & Relational**: We talk *to* people, not at them. Warm but not fluffy.

**Evidence-Led**: Always ready to show proof, stats, or deltas.

**Market | Commercial Construction Space, $20-$100m Range**

**Top Trends**

1. **Labor / Workforce Constraints[^1]**  
   * Persistent worker shortages remain a top issue. A report by Arcoro notes that the construction sector (commercial included) has hundreds of thousands of open jobs; many contractors are reporting project delays due to lack of available skilled labor.   
   * For firms in the $20-100M range, these shortages can be especially disruptive: they may not have the same pull or budget as large contractors to lure in high-skill workers, and delays eat into margins.  
2. **Cost Inflation, Material Price Volatility & Supply Chain Issues[^2]**  
   * Across the commercial segment, material input costs have been rising (steel, concrete, specialty finishes etc.), and supply chain delays continue to create risk in project scheduling.   
   * Firms in this revenue band tend to have less scale to pre-buy or hedge inputs, meaning cost overruns are more dangerous.  
3. **Interest Rates / Financing & Cash Flow Stress[^3]**  
   * High interest rates impact financing of projects and cost of capital; for commercial construction, financing delays or constricted credit can slow down deal flow.   
   * Cash flow is especially critical because commercial contracts are often large and long, with payment schedules that may delay revenues while expenses (labor, materials) are front loaded.   
4. **Regulatory, Permitting & Compliance Risk[^4]**  
   * Zoning, permitting, code requirements, environmental regulations are increasingly complex. Delays in permits or changes in rules (e.g. sustainability / emissions) can force changes or rework.   
   * For mid-sized commercial GC (general contractors), handling this risk well is essential to avoid cost overruns or legal exposure.  
5. **Technology & Productivity Gap[^5]**  
   * Many smaller/mid-sized commercial general contractors lag in adoption of advanced tech (e.g. BIM, digital twin, scheduling automation, data analytics). Technology can improve scheduling, reduce rework, improve cost control, but requires investment.   
   * Also, documentation, project management tools, subcontractor integration are often less systematic in this size band.  
6. **Margin Pressure[^6]**  
   * Because of cost inflation, labor / supply chain risk, commercial firms are seeing squeezed margins. The benchmarks suggest that firms need strong estimating, strict cost controls, and risk management to stay profitable.   
   * Overhead (insurance, bonding, administrative) tends to consume a larger % of revenue in smaller to mid-sized firms than in large ones, making any inefficiency or delay more damaging.  
7. **Market Demand & Mix Volatility[^7]**  
   * Commercial starts (office, retail, industrial) are not uniformly strong; certain sectors like data centers, life sciences, or advanced manufacturing are showing growth, while traditional office/retail spaces are more uncertain.   
   * Geographical variance: regions with strong population growth, favorable regulatory or tax environments, or strong infrastructure investment will see better opportunity; others lag.

**The $50M Split** \= the inflection point where growth stops being just “more projects” and becomes about structural maturity.[^8]

* $20–50M firms compete on agility, regional reputation, and lean operations, while $50–100M firms must professionalize (systems, risk, tech adoption) to handle larger, institutional projects and broader geographies.  
  * **$20–50M firms** thrive on agility, lean ops, strong regional reputation, and cost control.  
  * **$50–100M firms** move into a “professionalized” tier: they need enterprise systems, stronger risk controls, and tech adoption to compete for institutional work, but they gain access to larger/more stable projects and clients.

| Area | $20–50M Firms | $50–100M Firms |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Project Scale** | $1–10M jobs (retail, mid-sized offices, small healthcare). | $10–40M jobs (hospitals, schools, data centers, industrial). |
| **Clients** | Local developers, private businesses. | Institutional/public clients (universities, hospitals, municipalities). |
| **Geographic Reach** | Single region/metro. | Multi-region, sometimes multi-state. |
| **Organization** | Lean leadership; principals hands-on. | More formal management (CFO, risk officer, HR, compliance). |
| **Risk & Systems** | High exposure to a few mid-sized jobs; less formalized systems. | Larger exposure on single big projects; need strong risk management and bonding. |
| **Margins**  | Gross: \~12–16% (GCs); Net: \~5–8% if well-run. | Similar ranges, but margin volatility rises with larger, complex jobs. |

**$50M Split** **Personas[^9]**

* $20–50M personas: Reach with scrappy, ROI-focused, accessible tools that keep agility intact.  
* $50–100M personas: Reach with strategic, credibility-building, enterprise-grade proofpoints that show you can scale them into institutional markets.

**Audience | Commercial General Contractors**

## **Pain Points**

Commercial GCs live in tension between operational volatility (labor, cash flow, supply chain) and strategic transformation (systems, credibility, competition). The pain points aren’t just financial, they’re deeply tied to identity, trust, and evolution.

1. **Labor Shortages & Retention**: Finding and keeping skilled workers (both trades and project leaders) is the \#1 operational bottleneck. Without reliable crews, projects slip, margins erode, and reputations suffer.  
2. **Cash Flow Stress**: Large upfront costs with slow or unpredictable payments put constant pressure on working capital. Retainage and delays create financial strain, making liquidity management a daily concern.  
3. **Cost Inflation & Supply Chain Volatility**: Unstable material prices and long lead times make estimating risky and delivery unpredictable. GCs often lack the scale to hedge costs or negotiate favorable terms.  
4. **Competition & Market Positioning**: Stuck between nimble local players (who undercut on price) and national firms (who win with systems and scale), mid-sized GCs must fight to differentiate without racing to the bottom.  
5. **Scaling & Structural Maturity (“The $50M Split”)**: As firms approach/ surpass $50M, they need to professionalize — CFOs, ERP systems, risk officers — but this adds overhead and cultural tension. Leaders must evolve identity from “hands-on builder” to “institutional partner.”

| Insight | What It Shows / Quotes | Relevance for $20-100M GCs |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Cash Flow / Payment Delays Are a Serious Stressor** | Many GCs struggle with unpredictable cash flows arising from long project cycles, delayed payments, and increasing material costs. Some firms take \>3 months to collect invoices.[^10]  | For firms without huge reserves, these delays force them to build in buffer, raise prices, or risk working capital crunches. |
| **Labor & Hiring Remain Critical Bottlenecks** | From AGC’s Hiring & Business Outlook: firms expect difficulty hiring to persist in 2025; “contractors face significant challenges when it comes to finding workers …”[^11] | In the $20-100M band, firms are large enough that needing more trades, foremen, managers is a recurring challenge. Recruitment, retention, safety culture matter. |
| **Cost Inflation, Material / Supply Chain Volatility** | From many reports: input price inflation, long lead times, risk of tariffs etc. | GCs must forecast not just labor cost rises but material surges; schedule risk due to delayed material deliveries is real. |
| **Risk Awareness ≠ Preparedness** | GC respondents identify major risks (cybersecurity, cost overruns, etc.), but also report being least prepared to address them.[^12] | This suggests opportunities: firms want both awareness and tools/solutions. Messaging / positioning that helps close the preparedness gap can be powerful. |
| **Backlog & Project Pipeline Divergence by Size** | Smaller/mid-sized firms (\< $100M) are seeing backlog decline; larger firms are expanding backlog. | Risk for $20-50M GCs: lower future visibility, more sensitivity to downturns. Larger ones are absorbing more large or institutional work. |
| **Clients Value Trust, Relationships, Clear Communication** | From subcontractor perspective: issues like bid-shopping badly damage trust; project manager and superintendent competence and fairness are key.[^13] | GCs’ reputation among subs, clients is not just “nice to have” it directly affects ability to recruit subs, win bids, and manage risk. |

## **Underlying Behavior & Values**

* ## **Precaution over risk appetite**: Many are risk-aware. They build contingencies, prefer predictable over speculative.

* **Relational stability**: Keeping subcontractors, clients satisfied; avoiding “bid-shopping” or being cheap in contracting because that kills reputation.  
* **Efficiency via process / tech**: Even if budgeting is tight, many are investing in tools (estimating software, workflow tracking, procurement systems) to reduce overhead, avoid rework, increase visibility.  
* **Resilience & flexibility**: Building buffers (schedule, supply, cash), moving away from just-in-time to just-in-case supply planning.  
* **Accountability & credibility as differentiators**: For jobs with higher stakes, firms leverage bonding, certifications, safety/quality practices as selling points.

## **Strategic Messaging Implications**

* ## **Messaging that emphasizes peace of mind & preparation**: not just “we do things fast” but “we protect you from surprises.”

* **Programs or content around workforce recruiting \+ retention culture**: showing you understand the struggle, can help with culture, safety, training.  
* **Supply / material risk tools**: ways to help GCs insulate from price/lead-time risk; e.g. flexible contracts, supplier networks, procurement partnerships.  
* **Trust & credibility signals**: show your own certifications, responsiveness, financial stability, safety records to reduce perceived risk by clients and subs.  
* **Emotional positioning**: recognition of stress / pressure they carry, celebrating craftsmanship, reliability, legacy, etc.

**Competitive** 

**Top 3 by Category**  
In this category, the real competition isn’t for attention, it’s for emotion. Every brand is selling a feeling, not just a function. They win when they make customers feel understood, safe, proud, or in control. The most powerful players don’t just offer solutions they shape belief and trust at the emotional level.

* **Abstrakt:** trusted lead-gen but dated, low-tech.  
* **Itransition:** tech powerhouse but faceless, not human.  
* **Square Waves:** energetic \+ AI-driven but shallow on construction knowledge.

|  | Abstrakt Marketing | Itransition | Square Waves | Whitespace for Sunrise |
| :---- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Positioning** | Lead-gen & marketing agency for construction firms. *“Fill your pipeline, win more bids.”* | Custom software developer for construction & enterprise. *“Automate, streamline, mitigate risk.”* | AI \+ marketing disruptor for B2B. *“Cut through the noise, build fast.”* | Sunrise is the builder’s builder: delivering confidence through a human-centered blend of lead-gen precision, construction expertise, and forward-leaning technology. |
| **Tone & Identity** | Professional, supportive, pragmatic. ROI-driven, direct. | Corporate, technical, serious. Reads like IT consulting brochure. | Edgy, irreverent, fast-moving. Startup/anti-corporate. | Sunrise can differentiate with human \+ confident \+ modern: trusted like Abstrakt, tech-savvy like Itransition, but with more personality than both. |
| **Services & Capabilities** | Lead generation, SEO, content, creative (proposals, video), staffing, CRM/rev ops. | Custom apps (ERP, CRM, PM tools, portals), analytics, emerging tech (AI/IoT/VR), enterprise integration. | AI/automation, digital marketing, SEO/content, audits, tech stack optimization, web dev. | Sunrise can own the overlap: marketing \+ digital \+ construction expertise. Add innovation layer (AI matching, analytics dashboards) to leapfrog Abstrakt; keep industry depth unlike Square. |
| **Audience & Focus** | Mid-to-large commercial contractors. 1 per market exclusivity. | Enterprise AEC (architects, engineers, contractors, suppliers). Broad, global. | B2B mid-market (multi-industry, including construction). | Sunrise can specialize narrowly in construction, signaling true category expertise, but modernize with tech-first story (where Abstrakt feels dated, Square lacks focus). |
| **Strategic Gaps** | Limited innovation; traditional marketing-heavy; not deep in tech. | No marketing/branding; feels impersonal; not tuned to smaller/mid-size contractors. | No construction-specific knowledge; edgy style may not land with traditional contractors. | Sunrise can stand apart by being the one player that knows construction deeply, embraces tech smartly, and speaks in a relatable, human voice. |
