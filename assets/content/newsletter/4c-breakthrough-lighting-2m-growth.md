**Subject: How one distributor grew $2M in the worst market in years**

**Preview: While competitors cut budgets, Breakthrough Lighting kept building pipeline. Here's what they did differently.**

Hey [FIRST NAME],

Abhi from Sunrise here. You and Jason talked about building more predictable growth for your business.

2025 has been rough for a lot of contractors and distributors.

Tariffs, uncertainty, projects on hold, interest rate chaos. I've heard the same story from at least a dozen people: budgets are tight, decisions are slow, and it feels like everyone's waiting to see what happens next.

Which is why what happened with Breakthrough Lighting this year is worth paying attention to.

They grew $2 million year-over-year in qualified opportunities. In 2025. While most of their competitors were pulling back.

Here's how they did it—and why the approach matters even more when markets get uncertain.

**They didn't stop when everyone else did.**

Joe Pineda, the owner of Breakthrough Lighting, told us this during a recent check-in:

"2025, we've had the rollercoaster of tariffs and uncertainty and jobs being put on hold... This is not the greatest year to compare year-over-year improvements because of turmoil. The fact that we had such a nice bump anyway speaks volumes."

While other distributors cut their marketing budgets and hunkered down, Joe kept running systematic outreach.

About 1,000 contacts per month to electrical contractors, designers, and GCs working on active projects with lighting scope.

The result? $15.67 million in total opportunities quoted in 2025 versus $13.7 million in 2024.

When the market recovers and everyone else is scrambling to rebuild their pipeline, Joe's already got relationships in place and projects moving.

**They treated us like a strategic partner, not a vendor.**

Most contractors hire a service, give them some parameters, and expect results. When results don't show up fast enough, they blame the vendor and move on to the next one.

Joe approached it differently from day one.

He calls it the "three-legged stool":

1. CRM (HubSpot) to organize and track all relationships
2. NetSuite for operational efficiency and financial management  
3. Systematic BD (us) for consistent relationship generation

All three working together. Not just bolting on another service and hoping it works.

Joe shared their ConstructConnect subscription with us so we could use it for targeting. We integrated with his internal BD team so we weren't duplicating their efforts. 

He wasn't looking for someone to "do his marketing." He was looking for a growth partner.

That mindset is why it worked.

**They focused on getting onto bid lists with bigger players.**

Generic outreach gets you generic results.

Breakthrough used ConstructConnect to target GCs and design-build firms working on active projects with lighting scope. 

The pitch wasn't "hire us for lighting." It was "we see you're working on the new office building on Main Street—we specialize in commercial lighting procurement and can quote this project for you."

When you reach someone working on a real project and offer relevant value, they respond.

The goal wasn't just to win one project. It was to get added to their vendor list so they'd keep sending bid requests for future projects.

It worked. Joe told us:

"We definitely have gotten into more of the bid vendor lists. The ConstructConnect campaign enabled us to access bigger design-build guys, bigger contractors. Once you get on the vendor list, they start sending you bids. They keep us busy."

Multiple bid list additions = recurring revenue streams with zero marginal acquisition cost.

**One example of how persistence pays off:**

Joe recently closed a project that came from an interior designer who didn't respond until the third outreach attempt.

First email: no response.  
Second email: no response.  
Third email: "Okay, let's talk."

That conversation turned into a Zoom call. The Zoom call turned into drawings and renderings. Now it's an active project in their pipeline.

If they'd given up after one attempt, that opportunity would have gone to someone else.

The numbers:

$13,500 invested over 9 months.  
$10 million in pipeline generated (Joe's direct attribution).  
$20,000 closed so far, with more in motion.  
25-30% more new relationships than they were generating organically.

Joe's take on working with us:

"Whatever you need from me in terms of a testimony, I'd be more than happy, man, because you guys have helped us out. We still think of you guys as a strategic partner more than anything else."

The lesson here isn't complicated.

When markets get tough, the contractors who keep investing in systematic relationship building come out ahead. The ones who pull back and wait for things to get better? They're starting from zero when conditions improve.

If you want to position your business for growth in 2026 instead of reacting when the market shifts, reply to this email and let's talk.
