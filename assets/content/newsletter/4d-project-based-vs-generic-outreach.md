**Subject: Project-based outreach gets 4X better results (here's the data)**

**Preview: We ran both approaches for multiple clients. The numbers are clear—here's which one wins and why.**

Hey [FIRST NAME],

Abhi here. You and Jason talked about building a more predictable pipeline for your business.

One question we get all the time: "Does it actually matter whether I target people working on specific projects versus just reaching out to GCs in my area?"

Short answer: yes. Massively.

We've run both types of campaigns for multiple clients, and the data is clear.

Project-based outreach (targeting decision-makers on active projects with your scope) gets 4X higher conversion rates than generic outreach.

Here's the breakdown and why it matters.

**The data from two different clients:**

Kings Drywall (California):
- ConstructConnect project-based: 17.65% conversion
- Generic GC outreach: 4.45% conversion
- **4X better results from project-based**

EFI (another specialty contractor):
- Project-based (ConstructConnect + Dodge): 7.69% conversion
- Generic engineering firm outreach: 1.69% conversion  
- **4.5X better results from project-based**

This isn't a fluke. It's validated across different trades, different markets, different time periods.

When you target people working on projects that actually need your services right now, they respond at 4-5X the rate of generic cold outreach.

**Here's why project-based targeting works better:**

When you send a generic email to a GC saying "we do drywall" or "we're a great electrical contractor," you're asking them to remember you for some hypothetical future project.

Maybe they need you. Maybe they don't. Maybe they'll remember you in 6 months when they're bidding a project. Probably not.

When you target someone working on a specific project that has your scope and you reference that project by name, the conversation is immediately relevant.

"We see you're working on the new office building on Grove Street. We specialize in commercial drywall and can quote this for you."

That's not spam. That's useful.

They either need your trade on that project or they don't. If they do, they respond.

**Here's how to actually do this:**

Most contractors have heard of ConstructConnect or Dodge but don't know how to use them effectively.

Here's the process:

**Step 1: Set up your filters**

Log into ConstructConnect or Dodge and create a filter based on:
- Your service area (50-mile radius, specific counties, whatever makes sense)
- Project type (commercial, industrial, residential, etc.)
- Project phase (planning/pre-bid, not already out to bid)
- Scope keywords (drywall, electrical, HVAC, whatever you do)

**Step 2: Export active projects every 2 weeks**

Run your filter and export the list. You'll get project details, decision-maker contact info, estimated value, scope description.

Don't wait a month. Projects move fast. Export every couple weeks and reach out while the project is still in planning or early bid phase.

**Step 3: Personalize your outreach**

Pull the project name, location, and scope into your message.

Template:
"Hi [Name], I saw you're working on [Project Name] in [City]. We specialize in [Your Trade] for [Project Type] and have worked on similar projects in the area. I'd like to quote this for you—can I send over our info?"

Not fancy. Just relevant and specific.

**Step 4: Follow up 3 times**

Send the initial email. Wait 4 days. Send a follow-up. Wait 7 days. Send a final follow-up.

A lot of responses come on attempt 2 or 3. People are busy. Persistence works if your message is valuable.

**The economic math:**

Let's say you're a drywall contractor and you send 100 emails.

Generic outreach: 4.45% conversion = 4-5 responses  
Project-based outreach: 17.65% conversion = 17-18 responses

Same effort. 4X more results.

Now factor in that project-based also delivers higher bid request rates (3.36% vs 0.24% in the Kings data—that's 14X better).

You're not just getting more responses. You're getting more immediate opportunities.

**The real difference:**

Kings Drywall generated $3 million in pipeline from $7,500 invested over 4 months using project-based targeting.

Cost per bid request: $1,250.  
Cost per relationship: $129.

If they'd used generic outreach at 1/4 the conversion rate, those numbers would be $5,000 per bid request and $516 per relationship.

Same investment, way worse results.

**Bottom line:**

If you're going to invest time and money into outreach, invest it in the approach that actually works.

Target people working on real projects that need your services right now. Reference those projects by name. Follow up persistently.

It's not complicated. It just requires discipline and the right tools.
