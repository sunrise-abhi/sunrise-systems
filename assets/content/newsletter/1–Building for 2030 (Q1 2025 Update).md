**Subject: Building for 2030**

Most construction marketing agencies are stuck in 2010\. We're building for 2030\.

My partner Jason and I have seen what passes for “marketing” in commercial construction these days—and honestly, we love it.

Why?

Because, for the most part… 

It sucks. 

Generic “conversion-optimized” websites. Sporadic social posts that don’t hit the mark. Hype videos that, if I had to guess, don’t actually generate projects.

And don’t even get me started on what we’ve seen in some of our clients' businesses from their ex-marketers. 😬

But here’s why we love it: the bar is low—and that’s a massive opportunity.

**Creative, forward-thinking firms have a clear path to step in and win with marketing that actually works.**

That's why our Q1 update has me genuinely excited about what we're building at Sunrise.

For one, we've been running hyper-targeted outreach campaigns for our clients that are bringing in immediate opportunities as well as potentially lucrative long-term relationships. 

We set up a filter in ConstructConnect based on each client’s ideal project characteristics, export the active projects in their area every two weeks, and reach out to each one with a personalized message. 

That generated 35 leads in just two months for a GC client, and 24 quote requests \+ 30 more leads for a lighting distributor. 

And these aren’t your typical “plz hire us” emails. We reference specific project details, demonstrate real value upfront, and keep things human—not spammy. The response has been fantastic.

We’re also helping clients stay top of mind with the people who are already in their network, plus the new leads we’re adding from our outreach campaigns, through newsletters like this one.

The newsletters we write are nothing like the corporate fluff you’d normally expect (if you’d expect anything at all).

Instead, we focus on delivering genuinely useful and engaging content that positions our clients as trusted experts—so when a project opportunity does come up, they’re top of mind.

Our branding and design capabilities have leveled up in Q1 too. We just launched a [complete rebrand for Breakthrough Lighting](http://breakthroughlighting.com) at LEDucation in New York, and we're wrapping up another for Kings Drywall. 

The Breakthrough Lighting project was our first major branding work, and honestly, when we took on the project at the end of last year, I had *no* idea how we were going to deliver. 

I just knew we had what it took to figure it out, and we did.

We’re super proud of how it turned out, and a massive shout out to Joe from Breakthrough Lighting for trusting us with his rebrand and being one of our biggest supporters.

**The combination of exceptional branding, data-driven outreach, and value-based engagement is helping our clients land short-term wins *and* lay the groundwork for long-term growth** – without looking and sounding like every other contractor, and without destroying their margins**.**

Another thing that’s going to set Sunrise apart going forward is our growing ability to develop custom software.

All of our core team members have backgrounds in software development, and we’ve been building internal tools and automations to streamline our campaign workflows and make everything faster, more effective, and more affordable for clients.

And we’re now exploring building a full project management suite for our largest client that connects marketing, lead generation, PM, and customer-facing workflows into a single system.

Most agencies can’t build marketing, sales, and custom software systems that actually work—especially not at the price we’re offering.

Going into Q2, we're *also* doubling down on LinkedIn strategy and SEO to build our clients’ personal brands and get them to the top of Google. 

You’ll be hearing more from me soon with deeper dives into what’s working, why, and how Sunrise is uniquely positioned to lead the next era of commercial construction marketing.

Because here’s the truth:

Construction companies don’t need more generic marketing.

They need focused, accountable, and *beautiful* systems that actually deliver projects—at a price point that makes sense.

At Sunrise, that’s exactly what we’re building.

For 2030 and beyond.
