**Subject: The first 90 days (here's what actually happens)**

**Preview: Delta went from zero to $12M pipeline in 90 days. Here's the month-by-month breakdown.**

Hey [FIRST NAME],

Abhi from Sunrise here. You spoke with Jason about building more predictable pipeline for your business.

One of the biggest questions we get: "What does this actually look like in practice? What should I expect in the first few months?"

Fair question. Most contractors have been burned by agencies that promise fast results and deliver nothing.

So I wanted to walk you through what the first 90 days looked like for Delta Constructionâ€”a 50-year design-build GC who went from referrals-only to $12 million in qualified bid opportunities in their first three months.

Here's the timeline, what we did in each phase, and what kind of results to expect.

**Month 1: Setup and first contact**

Week 1-2: We set up their targeting filters in Dodge and ConstructConnect.

For Delta, that meant:
- Commercial projects $500K-$5M in their service area
- Planning and pre-bid phase (not already out to bid)
- Four buyer personas: developers, architects, property managers, business owners

Week 3-4: First outreach campaign launches.

We sent about 400-500 emails targeting developers and architects working on active commercial projects.

Results in month 1: 8 relationships, 2 bid requests, 1 call booked.

Not massive, but proof of concept. People were responding, and a couple turned into immediate opportunities.

**Month 2: Response handling and momentum**

By month 2, we had responses coming in from the first campaign, and we launched the second channel (ConstructConnect architects).

This is when things start to compound.

You're following up with people who responded in month 1, while new campaigns are reaching fresh contacts.

We also refined the messaging based on what was working. Certain project types got better responses. Certain subject lines performed better. We adjusted.

Month 2 results: 18 relationships, 4 bid requests, 2 calls booked.

More than double month 1. The system was working, and we were optimizing as we went.

One of those bid requests turned into a $150K project that closed later in the campaign. That single win paid for the entire 8-month engagement and then some.

**Month 3: Multi-channel expansion**

By month 3, we added the third campaign (property managers) and ramped up volume across all channels.

Delta was also getting repeat bid requests from people we'd contacted in months 1 and 2. A developer we reached out to in month 1 sent a second project in month 3.

This is the compounding effect people miss.

You're not just generating one-off responses. You're building relationships that turn into recurring opportunities.

Month 3 results: 22 relationships, 5 bid requests, 3 bid list additions.

Total pipeline value by end of month 3: $12 million in qualified opportunities.

Investment through 90 days: about $4,000.

**What happens after 90 days:**

The system keeps running, and results continue to compound.

By month 8, Delta had:
- 112 total decision-maker relationships
- $15 million in qualified bid opportunities
- $550K in closed revenue
- 25+ repeat client relationships

Total investment: $10,675.

They're fully profitable on closed work alone, with another $15M in active pipeline.

**Why results accelerate over time:**

Month 1, you're starting from zero. You're building the lists, launching campaigns, learning what works.

Month 2, you're following up with month 1 responses while launching new campaigns. You're refining based on data.

Month 3, you've got multiple campaigns running, people are starting to come back with repeat opportunities, and your targeting is dialed in.

Months 4-8, the whole system is firing. You're reaching new contacts, nurturing relationships from earlier months, and closing deals that started 60-90 days ago.

It's not linear. It compounds.

**What to expect in your first 90 days:**

If you're a GC, design-build firm, or specialty contractor in a decent-sized market:

Month 1: 5-10 relationships, 1-3 bid requests  
Month 2: 10-20 relationships, 3-5 bid requests  
Month 3: 15-25 relationships, 4-7 bid requests

Those numbers will vary based on your trade, market, and how aggressive you want to be with volume.

But the pattern holds: month 1 is proof of concept, month 2 is momentum, month 3 is where things start to compound.

By the end of 90 days, you should have:
- 30-50+ decision-maker relationships
- 8-15 active bid opportunities
- 2-5 bid list additions
- At least one deal closed or close to closing

If you don't hit those numbers, something's wrong with the targeting or execution, and we fix it.

**The investment:**

Most clients spend $1,500-$2,500/month depending on volume and scope.

Over 90 days, that's $4,500-$7,500 to build a system that generates 6-7 figures in pipeline.

If you win one project, you're profitable. Everything after that is gravy.

**The biggest mistake contractors make:**

They treat the first month like a test. When they don't see 10 bid requests in 30 days, they bail.

The contractors who win are the ones who understand this is a system that builds momentum over 90 days, not a magic switch you flip for instant results.

Delta committed to 90 days minimum. They hit $12M in pipeline. They kept going and hit $15M by month 8.

If you're ready to build this kind of system for your business, reply to this email and let's map out your first 90 days.
