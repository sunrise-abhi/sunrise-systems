**Subject: 23% conversion in 30 days (here's how)**

**Preview: Kings Drywall sent 47 emails and got 7 opportunities. Here's the exact approach they used.**

Hey [FIRST NAME],

Abhi from Sunrise Systems here. You spoke with Jason about building a more predictable pipeline for your business.

I wanted to share something that happened last month with one of our clients that proves how fast this can work when you do it right.

Kings Drywall sent 47 emails in April targeting active drywall projects in their area.

11 decision-makers responded. That's a 23% conversion rate.

7 of those turned into immediate opportunities—3 direct bid requests and 4 bid list additions.

All in 30 days.

Here's what made that month work, and why you should steal this exact approach:

**1. They only contacted GCs working on projects with drywall scope.**

Most contractors send generic "we're great at what we do" emails to anyone who might need their trade.

Kings used ConstructConnect to filter for commercial projects that were actively in pre-bid with drywall in the scope. Then they reached out to the project manager or estimator listed on that specific project.

The difference? Instead of "Hey, we do drywall," the message was "We see you're working on the new medical office building on Grove Street. We specialize in commercial drywall and can quote this for you."

One is spam. The other is useful.

**2. They reached out during the planning phase, not when bids were due.**

Timing matters more than people think.

If you wait until a project hits the public bid boards, you're competing with 10 other subs who all got the same notification.

Kings contacted GCs 2-4 weeks before the bid deadline—early enough to get on the list, late enough that the project was real and moving forward.

**3. They personalized every single message.**

No mass templates. Every email referenced the specific project by name, the scope they saw listed, and how Kings could help.

It took more time upfront. But 23% of people responded instead of 2%.

**4. They followed up 3 times before moving on.**

Most contractors send one email and give up.

Kings had a simple system: first email, wait 4 days, second email, wait 7 days, third email, done.

A bunch of the responses came on the second or third attempt. People are busy. Persistence isn't annoying if you're providing value.

The result? 

$3 million in pipeline from a $7,500 investment over 4 months. Cost per bid request: $1,250. Cost per relationship: $129.

If Kings wins just one of those projects, they're 10X profitable on the entire campaign.

April was their best month, but the approach worked consistently. They averaged 12-23% conversion across the whole engagement because the system was sound.

This isn't some crazy secret strategy. It's just disciplined, project-based prospecting with good targeting and follow-up.

Most contractors don't do it because it requires setup and consistency. But the ones who do? They don't worry about where their next project is coming from.
