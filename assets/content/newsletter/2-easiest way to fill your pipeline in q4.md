Hey \[FIRST NAME GOES HERE\],

I’m Abhi and I run Sunrise Systems with my partner, Jason Trehan. He mentioned you wanted more predictability in the types of projects coming in, which is exactly what we do.

We help commercial contractors build predictable pipelines.

For example, Delta Construction, a 50-year design-build GC, went from referrals only to $12M in additional bid invites in four months after we set up the right systems.

Those same systems have brought them close to $20M in additional bid opportunities in the month of September alone.

I figured it might help to share a few approaches we’re using with clients right now.

Here are three guaranteed ways you can use in the next 30 days to kick off 2026 with projects in motion:

1\. Reconnect with qualified contacts.

Go back through the last 12 months of email and pull every contact you had a two-way exchange with. Put that list into a single sheet, then either send a direct update email or call the ones you want to work with most. Even a simple “we just wrapped \[X project\] and wanted to share” gets the ball rolling.

That’s how we helped our client, Delta Construction, send one follow-up email that turned into six separate projects, including work with national retailers like Bed Bath & Beyond and Famous Footwear.

2\. Go after pre-bid projects in your region.

Instead of fighting over open bids with ten competitors, filter ConstructConnect or Dodge for projects that are still in pre-bid or invite-only stages. These are less crowded and give you a better shot at getting in early. Mention the project by name in your outreach and tie your note directly to the scope.

3\. Ask your closest contacts for referrals.

Chances are, you have a network of developers, architects, or property managers you’ve worked with. Don’t just wait for their projects. Ask who else in their circle is budgeting or scoping work for 2026\. You’re usually one conversation away from someone who needs a contractor right now.

Q4 is your window to capture the right opportunities now instead of scrambling later.

Jason and I opened a couple of spots this month to walk contractors through their current approach.

We’ll point out what’s working, what’s not, and show you how to build a steadier system so you head into 2026 with predictability instead of guesswork.

Just hit reply and let’s schedule a time to chat.

Rooting for you,

Abhi Das
