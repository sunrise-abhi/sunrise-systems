**Subject: 34 relationships in one month (here's the breakdown)**

**Preview: Delta hit 11 bid requests in September by targeting multiple buyer types. Here's how they coordinated it.**

Hey [FIRST NAME],

Abhi here. You and Jason talked about getting more consistent bid opportunities instead of relying on referrals and luck.

I wanted to show you what a fully optimized month looks like when you run this kind of system the right way.

September 2025, one of our GC clients (Delta Construction) generated 34 new decision-maker relationships and 11 direct bid requests in 30 days.

Not from networking events or paying for leads. From systematic outreach to the right people at the right time.

Here's what made that month work—and why going after multiple buyer types at once creates better results than focusing on just one.

**They didn't just target GCs. They targeted everyone who influences which contractors get hired.**

Most contractors think the GC is the only person who matters.

But on a typical commercial project, the decision about which subs get invited to bid gets influenced by at least 3-4 different people:

- The project owner (developer or business owner funding it)
- The architect (especially on design-build)
- The property manager (if it's a renovation or tenant improvement)
- The GC's estimating team

Delta ran separate campaigns to all four groups in September. Same projects, different angles.

When you reach the architect AND the owner on the same project, your odds of getting on the bid list go way up. They're both telling the GC about you from different directions.

**They coordinated the campaigns so they didn't duplicate outreach.**

This is where most people screw it up.

You don't want to email the same person twice about the same project from different campaigns. That's sloppy and kills your credibility.

We built a system that checks which contacts are getting reached through which campaign, so if someone shows up on multiple lists (architect who also owns the development firm, for example), they only get one message—the most relevant one.

It takes more work upfront, but it's the difference between looking professional and looking like you're spamming.

**They focused on upstream influence.**

Here's something most contractors miss: architects and developers get involved 6-12 months before the GC even starts estimating.

If you build a relationship with an architect early, they can recommend you to the GC when the project moves forward. You're not fighting to get noticed—you're already the preferred option before bidding even starts.

Delta's September results:

- Dodge Owners campaign: 195 contacts → 25 relationships (12.82%) + 9 bid requests
- ConstructConnect Architects: 15 contacts → 2 relationships (13.33%)
- Other campaigns running in parallel

Total: 34 relationships, 11 bid requests, multiple entry points into the same projects.

The investment to generate all of that? About $1,300 for the month.

Now, September was a peak month. They don't hit those numbers every single month.

But it shows you what's possible when you build the system correctly and execute with discipline.

Over 8 months, Delta generated $15 million in qualified bid opportunities and closed $550K in revenue from a $10,675 total investment.

They're already 10X profitable, and they've got another $15M in active pipeline to work through.

The difference between this and what most contractors do?

Most contractors reach out to one type of buyer (usually just GCs) with generic messages and wonder why no one responds.

Delta built a system that reaches multiple stakeholders with relevant, project-specific messages—and the results compound.

If you want to see what this looks like for your market and trade, just reply and we'll map it out.
