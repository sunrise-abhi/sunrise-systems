  
Hey \[FIRST NAME GOES HERE\]\!

Abhi from Sunrise Systems here. You spoke with my partner, Jason Trehan, about getting ahead of your competition with better sales and marketing systems.

There’s a reason why you're always hearing about good projects after it's too late.

Turns out there are platforms tracking projects 6-18 months before they go public, and you’ve probably already heard of them—ConstructConnect, PlanHub, Dodge, etc.

The few contractors who leverage these platforms correctly are scooping up opportunities before they ever hit your radar.

Most contractors don’t know how to use this data effectively and think the platforms are a waste, which means there's a massive opportunity right there.

Here's how it works:

Projects show up in Planning/Documents phase 6-18 months before bidding  
You can set alerts to get notified for ideal project types in your service area, and export the relevant contact information when it’s available  
Reach out with a personalized email or call (and make sure to follow up at least 3 times) to get on the bid list  
But these platforms are just the beginning. Here are three other strategies that make your whole system even more effective:

1\. Build genuine relationships with architects and engineers. They're typically the first ones involved in new construction projects and have visibility into upcoming work long before contractors are even invited to bid. Stay in touch with these guys and don’t hit them up only when you need work.

2\. Join professional associations. Organizations like the American Institute of Architects (AIA) host industry events where you can build these key relationships. These connections often lead to direct invitations to bid instead of fighting in the usual feeding frenzy (speaking of which, we'll be at the Design-Build Conference & Expo in Vegas next month if you want to connect).

3\. Monitor local building permit filings. Municipal governments publish new permits online, often weeks or months before projects are formally announced. 95% of contractors don’t check these databases, but it's free intelligence that's hiding in plain sight.

The contractors who figure this out get to have conversations when clients are still thinking about their project, instead of when they're already talking to five other guys about price.

I'm putting together a complete guide covering all the early-stage intel strategies \- the platforms, the networking approach, permit monitoring, everything. Want me to send it over?

Just reply “yes”. And I got you.
