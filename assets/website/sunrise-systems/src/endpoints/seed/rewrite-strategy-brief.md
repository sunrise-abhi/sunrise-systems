# Sunrise Systems Website Rewrite - Strategic Brief

## Core Positioning

### Big Idea
**"Growth, engineered."**

What it means in practice:
- Systematic (not random) business development
- Measurable (not vague) outcomes
- Professional (not amateur) execution
- Treat BD the way contractors treat construction

### Unique Mechanism
**Integrated Sales + Marketing + Software system** (not siloed services or typical marketing agency)

The integration is the differentiator:
- **Sales** finds and delivers qualified bid invites on active projects
- **Marketing** positions you as the contractor GCs want to work with
- **Software** tracks everything and provides operational visibility

Most agencies offer marketing OR sales. We deliver an integrated growth system.

### Positioning Statement
We build scalable marketing and software systems for construction companies who are ready to grow. Every project starts with a clear plan, measurable goals, and real accountability. That's what "growth, engineered" means.

- $650K+ in closed revenue
- 191+ decision-maker relationships
- 865:1 average ROI

### 2. Specific Case Study Results (Proof)
- **Delta:** $2.135M pipeline, 2,135:1 ROI, 30 days, bid list already working ($35K opportunity)
- **Breakthrough:** $10M pipeline, 740:1 ROI, 9 months, $20K closed, $2M growth in down market

- Repeatable, not luck

### 5. CTA (Next Step)
Clear, low-friction next action

## Voice Principles

### Tone Rules
1. **Plainspoken** - No buzzwords ("synergy," "leverage," "cutting-edge")
2. **Direct** - Say what you mean, mean what you say
3. **Results-first** - Outcomes before process
4. **9th-grade readability** - Short sentences, clear meaning
5. **Concrete > Abstract** - "$2.135M" not "significant pipeline"
6. **Verifiable** - Only claims that can be proven
7. **Active voice** - "We build" not "solutions are built"
8. **Direct address** - "You" and "your"

### Rhythm and Flow
- Vary sentence length (short punchy + longer flowing)
- Use periods more than commas
- Whitespace equals confidence
- Brevity equals power
- Every word earns its place

### Tone Calibration Example
"We build scalable marketing and software systems for construction companies who are ready to grow. Every project starts with a clear plan, measurable goals, and real accountability. That's what 'growth, engineered' means."

**Why this works:**
- Short opening sentence (builds what, for who)
- Specific claim (clear plan, measurable goals, real accountability)
- Ties back to big idea (growth, engineered)
- No fluff, no filler

## Service Integration Story

### Not "Marketing Agency"
We're not:
- Just branding
- Just social media
- Just content creation
- Just website design

We're not "awareness" and "exposure."

### We're "Growth Partner"
We deliver:
- Qualified bid invites (Sales)
- Premium positioning (Marketing)
- Operational visibility (Software)

**Integration = Competitive Advantage**
- Sales finds projects → Marketing positions you for them → Software tracks it all
- Each service amplifies the others
- Siloed services leave gaps
- Integrated system drives growth

### Proof of Integration
- Breakthrough: Brand positioning + sales outreach = $10M pipeline
- EFI: Sales relationships + software foundation = complete growth system
- Delta: Systematic targeting + CRM integration = 2,135:1 ROI

---

## Differentiation Points

### vs. Marketing Agencies
- **Them:** Retainers for "brand awareness," no measurable outcomes
- **Us:** Deliver bid invites, track ROI, prove results

### vs. Sales/BDR Services
- **Them:** Just outreach, no positioning or infrastructure
- **Us:** Integrated system (sales + marketing + software)

### vs. SaaS Platforms
- **Them:** $12K-$24K/year forever, generic features, vendor lock-in
- **Us:** Build what you own, custom for your needs, no monthly fees (software service)

### vs. Word of Mouth
- **Them:** Unscalable, unpredictable, limited growth
- **Us:** Systematic, measurable, scalable alongside existing relationships

## Copy Strategy by Section

### Hero Sections
- Lead with concrete outcome ("Bid invites on projects you actually want")
- Follow with specific benefit (not vague promise)
- Keep headline ≤12 words
- Keep subhead ≤2 lines
- No jargon, no clichés

### Stats/Metrics Sections
- Aggregate first ($29MM+, 865:1)
- Specific second (Delta, Breakthrough, Kings)
- Always attribute (client-confirmed, not vendor claims)
- Context matters ("in 30 days," "in down market")

### Service Sections
- Start with client outcome (not service description)
- Problem → Solution → Proof
- Deliverables = tangible (not vague)
- Each service ≤20 words description + 3-4 bullet benefits

### Process Sections
- 3 steps maximum
- Each step ≤25 words
- Show simplicity (demystify)
- Action-oriented language

### Testimonial Sections
- Real quotes (exact words)
- Real attribution (name, title, company)
- Placement after claims (proof follows promise)

### CTA Sections
- Headline ≤8 words
- Subhead ≤15 words
- Single clear action
- Low friction

---

## Block-Level Constraints

### Enforced Limits
- **HeroBlock headline:** ≤12 words
- **HeroBlock subhead:** ≤2 lines (content)
- **StatementBlock:** ≤40 words total
- **FeatureGridBlock description:** ≤20 words each
- **ProcessBlock step:** ≤25 words each
- **CallToActionBlock headline:** ≤8 words
- **CallToActionBlock subhead:** ≤15 words
- **ServicePreviewBlock headline:** ≤8 words
- **ServicePreviewBlock subhead:** ≤20 words

### Why These Limits Matter
- Force clarity (can't hide behind fluff)
- Ensure scannability (visual hierarchy)
- Maintain rhythm (varied but controlled)
- Respect reader attention (brevity = power)

---

## Minimalism Enforcement

### Red Flags to Eliminate
- "Solutions" (use specific noun instead)
- "Leverage" (use "use" instead)
- "Cutting-edge" (show, don't tell)
- "Innovative" (prove it instead)
- "Transform" (be specific about change)
- "Seamless" (overused, meaningless)
- "Robust" (show capabilities instead)
- "Holistic" (say what you actually do)

### If Section Feels Wordy
1. Cut adjectives first
2. Combine sentences
3. Remove redundancy
4. Ask: "Does this earn its place?"
5. Shorten or delete

---

## Brand Values (How We Work)

## Story Arc (Sunrise Origin)

### The Problem
- Founded 2024
- Construction marketing stuck in 2010 (generic websites, sporadic social, hype videos that don't generate projects)

### The Solution
- Three partners (software dev, agency ops, enterprise systems)
- Built different: integrated growth partner (sales + marketing + software)
- Bootstrapped $3K → $29K MRR in 8 months
- Proved results first, scaled what works

### The Difference
- No retainer contracts for "exposure"
- Deliver qualified bid invites, measurable growth, operational visibility
- Every tool built ourselves
- Every process tested internally
- Every metric provable

### The Philosophy
Treat BD the way contractors treat construction: systematically, measurably, professionally.

## Audience Mindset Shifts

### From → To

**From:** Word of mouth only  
**To:** Word of mouth + systematic BD

**From:** Compete on price  
**To:** Win on reputation and positioning

**From:** React to inbound  
**To:** Proactive outbound + strong brand

**From:** "Marketing doesn't work for construction"  
**To:** "Wrong marketing doesn't work—systematic BD does"

**From:** Guessing at results  
**To:** Tracking every metric

**From:** Vendor relationships  
**To:** Strategic partnerships

---

## Key Messaging Themes

- Track every relationship
- Track ROI

### Integrated vs. Siloed
- Sales finds it
- Marketing positions you for it
- Software tracks it

### Ownership vs. Rental
- Build what you own (software)
- Not trapped in SaaS fees
- Control your infrastructure

### Proof vs. Promise
- Client-confirmed metrics
- Real closed revenue
- Honest attribution

---

## Image/Visual Strategy

**For this rewrite phase:**
- All image fields: leave empty/TBD
- Focus on copy structure and messaging
- Visual decisions = separate phase

**Future visual direction:**
- Clean, minimal, professional
- Show proof (dashboards, metrics)
- Real project photos (not stock)
- Team photos (real people)
- Case study visuals (before/after)

---

## Success Criteria

**Copy is ready when:**
- Every block meets word count constraints
- Tone matches calibration example
- Proof follows hierarchy (aggregate → specific → testimonial → process → CTA)
- No buzzwords or jargon
- Direct, plainspoken, results-first
- Every word earns its place
- Dynamic placeholders reference correct IDs
- "Growth, engineered" positioning clear throughout

**Copy needs revision when:**
- Feels wordy or repetitive
- Uses vague promises instead of specific outcomes
- Relies on adjectives instead of proof
- Sounds like "typical marketing agency"
- Lacks client attribution or proof points
- Violates word count constraints
- Contains buzzwords or clichés
