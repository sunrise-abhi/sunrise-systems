## Tone Calibration Check

**Reference:** "We build scalable marketing and software systems for construction companies who are ready to grow. Every project starts with a clear plan, measurable goals, and real accountability. That's what 'growth, engineered' means."

> "Stop losing to inferior competitors. Stop bidding where the decision is already made. Get in front of decision-makers on active projects that match your capabilities—before bid lists close."

**Analysis:**
- Short, punchy sentences
- Direct commands ("Stop losing")
- Concrete outcome ("before bid lists close")
- No fluff, no filler
- ✅ MATCHES tone calibration

**Sample from service-software-rewrite.ts:**
> "Off-the-shelf tools force you into their mold. We build custom software for your specific operational challenges—from rescuing legacy data to creating dashboards you own."

**Analysis:**
- Problem → Solution structure
- Concrete examples ("rescuing legacy data")
- Ownership theme ("dashboards you own")
