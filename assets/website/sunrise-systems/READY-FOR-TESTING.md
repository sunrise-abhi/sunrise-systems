## üéØ How to Complete the Implementation

### Step 1: Access the Admin Panel

The dev server is running at: **http://localhost:3000**

1. Navigate to **http://localhost:3000/admin**
2. Login with existing credentials (or create new admin user if needed)

### Step 2: Run the Seed Script

**Option A: Via Admin Panel (Recommended)**
1. Once logged in, look for a "Seed" option in the admin panel
2. Click "Run Seed" or navigate to **http://localhost:3000/next/seed** while logged in

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/next/seed \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN_HERE"
```

**Option C: Manual Creation (fallback)**
If automated seeding doesn't work, you can manually create content:
1. Go to Services collection ‚Üí Create New ‚Üí Copy data from services-seed.ts
2. Go to Case Studies collection ‚Üí Create New ‚Üí Copy data from case-studies-seed.ts
3. Go to Pages collection ‚Üí Edit Home ‚Üí Replace with data from home-sunrise.ts

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### If Seed Fails:
1. Check MongoDB connection in Railway dashboard
2. Verify DATABASE_URI environment variable
3. Check console for specific error messages
4. Try manual content creation as fallback

### If Pages Don't Load:
1. Check that seed script completed successfully
2. Verify collections were created (check admin panel)
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Verify dynamic routes are working (/services/[slug], etc.)

### If Styles Look Wrong:
1. Verify Tailwind is compiling (check browser inspector)
2. Check that safelist includes dynamic classes
3. Verify CSS is being loaded
4. Check for conflicting styles
