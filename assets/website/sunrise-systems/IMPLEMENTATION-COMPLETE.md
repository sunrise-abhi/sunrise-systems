## üé¨ Next Immediate Actions

1. **Start the dev server** and access the admin panel
2. **Run the seed script** via /next/seed endpoint

## üìñ Architecture Notes

### Block-Based Content Model:
Every page is built from reusable blocks. This makes it easy to:
- Rearrange sections via drag-and-drop in CMS
- Add new sections without code changes
- Reuse components across pages
- Maintain design consistency

### Collection Relationships:
- Pages can reference Services via ServiceSummaryBlock
- Pages can reference Case Studies via CaseStudySummaryBlock
- Header/Footer can link to any page in any collection

### Static Generation:
- All pages are statically generated at build time
- `generateStaticParams()` ensures all routes are pre-rendered
- Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR) on content updates

---

## üêõ Known Limitations / Future Enhancements

### Current Limitations:
1. **Simplified Content:** Seed data uses condensed versions of markdown content
2. **Missing Images:** Placeholder structure exists, but actual images need uploading
3. **Basic Styling:** Tailwind classes are functional but can be refined
4. **Limited Pages:** Only 5 of 12 intended pages are seeded

### Recommended Enhancements:
1. **Expand Seed Content:** Convert full markdown files to block structures
2. **Add More Pages:** Create seeds for DBIA landing page and remaining content
3. **Image Management:** Upload and properly reference all brand assets
4. **Custom Tailwind Theme:** Configure brand-specific design tokens
5. **Advanced Blocks:** Create more specialized blocks if needed (e.g., ComparisonTableBlock, TimelineBlock)
6. **Search:** Configure Payload's search plugin for site-wide search
7. **Forms:** Add custom forms beyond contact (e.g., pipeline audit request)
