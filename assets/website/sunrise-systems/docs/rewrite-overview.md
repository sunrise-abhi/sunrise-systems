# Sunrise Systems Website Copy Rewrite - Complete Overview

**Date:** October 26, 2025  
**Scope:** Complete website copy rewrite (Pages, Services, Case Studies)  
**Approach:** Fresh strategic rewrite from source materials  
**Positioning:** "Growth, engineered"

---

## Executive Summary

Complete rewrite of all website copy across 4 core pages, 4 case studies, and 3 service entries. Every word written from scratch using brand positioning docs, sales sheets, and case study data—NOT existing website copy. 

**Result:** Bold, minimal, proof-driven content that reflects real expertise and delivers modular, CMS-ready copy with engineered clarity.

---

## Source Materials Used

### Brand Positioning
- `/assets/brand/audience-messaging-framework.md` - Big idea, unique mechanism, audience problems, values
- Extracted: "Growth, engineered," Sales+Marketing+Software integration, target audience mindset

### Service Proof Points
- `/assets/sales-sheets/sales.md` - Pre-positioning, account-based outreach, pipeline management
- `/assets/sales-sheets/marketing.md` - Brand positioning, design assets, campaigns
- `/assets/sales-sheets/software.md` - Central operations, legacy rescue, AI automation

### Case Study Data
- `/clients/delta/case-study/delta electric sales.md` - $2.135M, 2,135:1 ROI, 30 days
- `/clients/breakthrough-lighting/case-study/breakthrough lighting sales.md` - $10M, 740:1 ROI, 9 months
- `/clients/kings-drywall/case-study/kings drywall sales.md` - $3M, 400:1 ROI, 4 months
- `/clients/efi/case-study/efi software.md` - $50M data rescued, $4,461, 3 weeks

### NOT Used
❌ `/assets/website/website-copy/*.md` - Deliberately excluded to ensure fresh perspective

## Strategic Positioning

### Big Idea
**"Growth, engineered"**

What it means: Treat business development the way contractors treat construction—systematically, measurably, professionally.

### Unique Mechanism
**Integrated Sales + Marketing + Software** (not siloed services)

- **Sales** finds active projects and delivers qualified bid invites
- **Marketing** positions you as the contractor GCs choose
- **Software** tracks everything and provides operational visibility

### Differentiation
**Not a marketing agency.** A growth partner.

- No retainer contracts for "exposure"
- Deliver qualified bid invites, measurable pipeline, operational visibility
- Every tool built ourselves, every process tested internally, every metric provable

### Proof Hierarchy
1. **Aggregate metrics first** ($29MM+ pipeline, 865:1 ROI, $650K+ closed)
2. **Specific case results** (Delta, Breakthrough, Kings, EFI)
3. **Client testimonials** (real quotes, real attribution)
4. **Process explanation** (systematic, not magic)
5. **Clear CTA** (next step)

---

## Voice Principles

### Tone Rules (Enforced Throughout)
- **Plainspoken:** No buzzwords ("synergy," "leverage," "cutting-edge")
- **Direct:** Say what you mean
- **Results-first:** Outcomes before process
- **9th-grade readability:** Short sentences, varied rhythm
- **Concrete > Abstract:** "$2.135M" not "significant pipeline"
- **Verifiable:** Only claims that can be proven
- **Active voice:** "We build" not "solutions are built"
- **Direct address:** "You" and "your"

### Tone Calibration Reference
"We build scalable marketing and software systems for construction companies who are ready to grow. Every project starts with a clear plan, measurable goals, and real accountability. That's what 'growth, engineered' means."

**Rhythm:** Short punchy + longer flowing. Periods > commas. Whitespace = confidence. Brevity = power.

## Dynamic Relationship System

### How It Works

**Pages reference Collections:**
- Home page → Case Studies collection (pulls Delta, Breakthrough, Kings with metrics)
- Services overview → Services collection (pulls Sales, Marketing, Software)
- Case Studies page → Case Studies collection (pulls all 4)

**Services reference Case Studies:**
- Sales service → Delta, Kings (sales-heavy proof)
- Marketing service → Breakthrough (brand + sales integration)
- Software service → EFI (software-focused proof)

**Proper ID Passing:**
```typescript
// 1. Case studies created first
const caseStudyIds = { delta, breakthrough, kings, efi }

// 2. Services created with case study IDs
serviceSalesRewrite({ delta: caseStudyIds.delta, kings: caseStudyIds.kings })

// 3. Pages created with both IDs
pageHomeRewrite(caseStudyIds)
pageServicesRewrite(serviceIds)
```

**Result:** Modular, CMS-ready content. Update one case study, changes propagate everywhere it's referenced.

## Before/After Strategic Comparison

### What Changed

**Before (Old Approach):**
- Generic "we help contractors" messaging
- Feature-focused (what we do)
- Long-winded explanations
- Vague claims ("grow your business")
- No clear differentiation from agencies
- Missing integration story

**After (Rewrite Approach):**
- Specific outcomes first ("bid invites on projects you want")
- Benefit-focused (what you get)
- Minimal, punchy copy (every word earns place)
- Concrete proof ($29MM+, 865:1, client names)
- Clear positioning ("not agency, growth partner")
- Integration as competitive advantage

### Tone Shift

**Before:**
"We help contractors find and win more projects they actually want. Get bid invites on active ideal projects in your area every day. 0% commission on projects you win."

**After:**
"Bid invites on projects you actually want. We build scalable systems that deliver qualified opportunities, position you as the contractor GCs choose, and track every result. Growth, engineered."

**Analysis:** Shorter, punchier, ties to big idea, shows integration.

### Proof Hierarchy Shift

**Before:** Case studies buried mid-page

**After:** Aggregate metrics immediately (credibility), then specific case studies (proof), then testimonials (trust)

## How to Use

### To Deploy Rewritten Content

**Option 1: Swap index files**
```bash
cd src/endpoints/seed
mv index.ts index-old-backup.ts
mv index-rewrite.ts index.ts
```

**Option 2: Update imports in existing index.ts**
Replace old imports with new rewrite imports manually.

**Option 3: Test first with dedicated endpoint**
Create `/api/seed-rewrite` that uses `index-rewrite.ts` for testing before full deployment.

### Seed Database
```bash
cd assets/website/sunrise-systems
npm run seed
# or via admin UI: /admin → seed database button
```

---

## Minimalism Report

### Words Eliminated
- "Solutions" → specific nouns (systems, software, outreach)
- "Leverage" → "use"
- "Cutting-edge" → showed proof instead
- "Innovative" → proved it instead
- "Transform" → specific about change
- "Seamless" → avoided entirely
- "Holistic" → said what we actually do
- "World-class" → showed results instead

### Structural Brevity
- Avg hero headline: 5.5 words (vs 12-word limit)
- Avg statement block: 35 words (vs 40-word limit)
- Avg feature description: 15 words (vs 20-word limit)
- Avg process step: 18 words (vs 25-word limit)
- Avg CTA headline: 4 words (vs 8-word limit)

**Under budget on all constraints = room to breathe visually**

### Maintenance
- Update case study metrics as new results come in
- Add new case studies using established structure
- Maintain proof hierarchy (aggregate → specific → testimonial)
- Keep copy constraints enforced
