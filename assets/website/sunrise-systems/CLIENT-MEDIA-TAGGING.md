# Client Media Tagging - Implementation Complete

## What Was Added

### New Clients Collection
- **Location:** Collections → Clients
- **Fields:**
  - Name (required) - e.g., "Delta Electric", "Breakthrough Lighting"
  - Slug (auto-generated from name) - e.g., "delta-electric"

### Updated Media Collection
- **New Field:** Client (optional relationship)
- **Location:** Appears in sidebar when uploading/editing media
- **Behavior:** Dropdown selector showing all available clients

## How to Use

### 1. Create Clients First
1. Go to admin panel: `/admin`
2. Click **Collections → Clients**
3. Click **Create New**
4. Enter client name (e.g., "Delta Electric")
5. Slug auto-generates (e.g., "delta-electric")
6. Save

### 2. Tag Media with Clients
**When uploading new media:**
1. Go to **Collections → Media**
2. Click **Create New**
3. Upload your file
4. In the sidebar, select **Client** from dropdown
5. Save

**For existing media:**
1. Go to **Collections → Media**
2. Click on any media file
3. In the sidebar, select **Client** from dropdown
4. Save

### 3. Filter and Organize
**View media by client:**
1. Go to **Collections → Media**
2. Use the filter panel to filter by client
3. Or click into a Client record to see all related media

**View all client media:**
1. Go to **Collections → Clients**
2. Click on a client
3. Related media will be referenced

## Features

### What You Can Do
- ✅ Create and manage clients (just name + slug)
- ✅ Tag media files with a client
- ✅ Filter media by client in admin panel
- ✅ Organize logos, images, and assets by client
- ✅ Search for client-specific media
- ✅ Bulk operations on client media

### What's Optional
- Media doesn't require a client (existing media still works)
- Can leave client field empty for general media
- One media file = one client (keeps it simple)

## Example Workflow

### Organizing Client Logos
1. Create clients:
   - "Delta Electric"
   - "Breakthrough Lighting"
   - "America 9"
   - "Design Alternatives"
   - "3i"
   - "EFI"

2. Upload/tag logos:
   - Upload "Delta-Logo-Small.webp" → Tag with "Delta Electric"
   - Upload "Breakthrough-Logo-Small.webp" → Tag with "Breakthrough Lighting"
   - Upload "A9-Logo-Small.webp" → Tag with "America 9"
   - etc.

3. Find media:
   - Filter media by "Delta Electric" → See all Delta assets
   - Filter media by "Breakthrough Lighting" → See all Breakthrough assets

## Technical Details

### Collection Slugs
- Clients collection: `clients`
- Media collection: `media`

### TypeScript Types
Generated in `src/payload-types.ts`:
```typescript
interface Client {
  id: string
  name: string
  slug: string
  updatedAt: string
  createdAt: string
}

interface Media {
  // ... other fields
  client?: (string | null) | Client
}
```

### Access Control
- **Read:** Anyone (public)
- **Create/Update/Delete:** Authenticated users only

### Database
- Stores client reference in Media documents
- MongoDB relationship (stores client ID)
- Can populate full client data when querying

## Future Enhancements

If you want to expand later, you can easily add:
- Client logo field (direct relationship to media)
- Client website URL
- Client description
- Client contact information
- Project count
- Date added
- Tags/categories for clients
- Multiple clients per media file

For now, it's minimal and focused on tagging/organization! ✅
