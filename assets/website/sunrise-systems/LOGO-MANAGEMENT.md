# Logo Management via CMS

## Feature Added

You can now manage the Header and Footer logos through the Payload admin panel!

## How to Update Your Logo

### Step 1: Upload Logo to Media (Already Done âœ…)
You've already uploaded the Sunrise Systems logo to the Media collection.

### Step 2: Set Logo in Header
1. Go to `/admin`
2. Click **Globals â†’ Header** in the sidebar
3. You'll now see a **Logo** field at the top
4. Click the dropdown and select your uploaded Sunrise Systems logo
5. Click **Save**

### Step 3: Set Logo in Footer
1. Go to `/admin`
2. Click **Globals â†’ Footer** in the sidebar
3. You'll now see a **Logo** field at the top
4. Click the dropdown and select your uploaded Sunrise Systems logo
5. Click **Save**

### Step 4: Refresh Your Site
The header and footer will now display your uploaded logo!

## How It Works

### Header
- If you set a logo in Header global â†’ Uses your uploaded logo
- If no logo is set â†’ Falls back to the default hardcoded logo

### Footer
- If you set a logo in Footer global â†’ Uses your uploaded logo
- If no logo is set â†’ Falls back to the default hardcoded logo

This means the site will never break if you haven't set a logo yet.
