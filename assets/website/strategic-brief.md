# Sunrise Systems Website Strategic Brief

## 1. Project Overview

Sunrise Systems is a business development partner for commercial contractors, design-build firms, and specialty trades that delivers qualified bid invites, premium brand positioning, and custom operational software. The website is for growth-focused construction executives doing $2MM–$100MM+ in revenue who need predictable pipeline alongside their existing relationships. The website should feel powerful yet restrained—confident, direct, and grounded in measurable results rather than marketing promises.

**Big Idea:** Growth, engineered: business development built for commercial construction.

This central creative direction positions Sunrise not as a marketing agency, but as a systematic growth engine. Every page, every section, every line of copy should reinforce that growth here is methodical, measured, and engineered—not accidental. The Big Idea connects construction's preference for precision and systems with the need for reliable business development.

## 2. Copywriting & Brand Voice Guidelines

The site should sound like a confident expert talking to another expert—plainspoken, direct, and economical with words. Write in the active voice. Lead with tangible outcomes, not process. Use short sentences and paragraphs. Avoid marketing jargon ("solutions," "leverage," "synergy"), hype, or overselling. State facts that can be proven. When describing value, be specific: "$10MM in bid invites" beats "significant pipeline growth." The rhythm should be crisp and deliberate—nothing wasted, nothing fluffy. This is the voice of someone who has done the work and doesn't need to convince you it's real. The work speaks.

## 3. Page-by-Page Breakdown

### Home

**Page Goal:** Immediately establish what Sunrise does (delivers bid invites), prove it works (case study metrics), and create a clear path to engagement.

**Big Idea Application:** The homepage is where "growth, engineered" becomes tangible. Show the systematic process: identify projects, reach decision-makers, deliver bid invites. Use precise metrics (not ranges) to demonstrate the engineering: $15MM pipeline from $10,675 investment is engineered growth, not luck.

**Details:** Open with the current site's directness—"Real bid invites delivered to your estimating team." Immediately prove this with case study results from Delta ($15.55MM pipeline + $550K closed), Breakthrough Lighting ($10MM pipeline), and Kings Drywall ($3MM pipeline). Show the three service lines as an integrated system, not separate offerings. Include client testimonials that emphasize results and partnership quality. The hero should mirror the current site's benefit-first approach. Avoid explaining "what we do" in abstract terms—show what clients get.

### Services

**Page Goal:** Position Sales, Marketing, and Software as a unified growth system rather than à la carte services.

**Big Idea Application:** Engineered growth requires all three components working together. Sales finds the opportunities. Marketing positions you for them. Software makes it all systematic and scalable. Present this as architecture, not a menu.

**Details:** Draw from the sales-sheets/overview.md structure but simplify. Show how the three services interlock: outbound sales delivers immediate opportunities, brand positioning makes you the preferred choice, and custom software systematizes everything for scale. Avoid feature dumping. Focus on the outcome of the system working together. Use language from the audience-messaging-framework.md around "predictable pipeline" and "choosing projects you want, not just what comes along."

### Service: Lead Generation & Sales Support

**Page Goal:** Demonstrate how systematic outreach generates qualified bid invites without the spray-and-pray approach contractors associate with "sales."

**Big Idea Application:** This is engineering applied to prospecting. Not cold calling, not spam—intelligent targeting based on project databases, personalized outreach to decision-makers, and systematic follow-up that builds relationships.

**Details:** Pull from sales.md and the Delta/Kings case studies. Open with the pain: unsteady project flow, losing to inferior competitors, bidding on projects where decisions are already made. Show the approach: project-based targeting using ConstructConnect and Dodge, account-based relationship building, pre-positioning before bid lists close. Include specific results: Delta's 112 relationships from 3,910 contacts (2.86% conversion), Kings' 23.40% conversion in peak month. Emphasize that this generates both immediate bid requests AND long-term repeat client relationships.

### Service: Branding & Marketing

**Page Goal:** Show how premium positioning attracts better opportunities and builds credibility with GCs and developers.

**Big Idea Application:** Engineered growth requires being the obvious choice, not the cheapest option. Strategic brand positioning is infrastructure, not decoration.

**Details:** Draw from marketing.md and the Breakthrough Lighting rebrand work mentioned in newsletters. Address the reality that 92% of GCs research contractors online before reaching out. Show what premium positioning delivers: brand voice that differentiates, website that builds credibility, LinkedIn strategy that keeps you visible, content that positions expertise. Reference the newsletter about "building for 2030" and how most construction marketing is stuck in 2010. Keep it grounded—this isn't about looking pretty, it's about commanding attention and being remembered when projects arise.

### Service: Custom Software Development

**Page Goal:** Establish that Sunrise builds operational technology that solves real construction business problems, not just off-the-shelf CRM setup.

**Big Idea Application:** Growth at scale requires systems. Custom software is the ultimate expression of "engineered"—technology built specifically for your workflows, your data, your operational challenges.

**Details:** Reference software.md and the internal tools mentioned in current-status-overview.md (OutreachSphere, ContentSphere, C0). Show the spectrum: centralized operations dashboards, legacy database modernization (1994-2007 project data extraction example), custom CRM that replaces bloated systems like Procore. Emphasize the team's technical background (all founders have software development experience). Position this as operational leverage—technology that gives visibility, reduces manual work, and connects fragmented systems. Use the Kings testimonial about "long-term impact" and "money well spent."

### About

**Page Goal:** Build credibility through real backgrounds and demonstrated results, not corporate mission statements.

**Big Idea Application:** The people engineering your growth have built systems, scaled businesses, and understand both construction and technology deeply.

**Details:** Brief origin: founded 2024, bootstrapped, grew from $3K to $29K MRR in eight months. Introduce the three partners using team.md: Abhi (strategy, creative, systems), Jason (sales, relationships, client success), Naram (software, technical operations, infrastructure). Show their backgrounds (computer science, enterprise systems, agency operations) as proof they can engineer growth. Keep bios factual and achievement-oriented. Include the philosophy from current-status-overview.md about building for 2030, not 2010. Values shown through actions: they build their own software, they track every metric, they prove ROI.

### Case Studies (Overview)

**Page Goal:** Let results speak through scannable metrics that establish credibility immediately.

**Big Idea Application:** Engineered growth is measurable growth. Lead with numbers, not stories.

**Details:** Create a results-first layout showing key metrics for each client: Delta ($15.55MM total pipeline, $550K closed, 1,457:1 ROI), Breakthrough ($10MM pipeline, $20K closed, 740:1 ROI), Kings ($3MM pipeline, 400:1 ROI, 23.40% peak conversion), EFI (project-based targeting outperforms general by 4.5X). Categorize by contractor type (GC, specialty contractor, distributor) so visitors can find relevant proof. Include timeframes to show speed of results. Make it scannable—decision-makers should grasp the proof in 30 seconds.

### Case Study: Delta

**Page Goal:** Tell the complete story of how an 8-month engagement generated $15.55MM in value for a design-build GC.

**Big Idea Application:** Show the engineering: multi-stakeholder targeting (developers, architects, property managers, business owners), multi-channel approach (Dodge, ConstructConnect), systematic relationship building that generated 112 decision-maker connections.

**Details:** Use delta gc sales.md extensively. Context: GC needed predictable pipeline beyond referrals. Approach: project-based outreach across four buyer personas, account-based relationship building, pipeline management integration. Results: $15MM+ in qualified opportunities, $550K closed revenue, 112 relationships, 21 bid requests, 25+ repeat clients. Investment: $10,675. ROI: 1,457:1 pipeline multiple, 51.5:1 realized ROI, client reached 10.3X break-even. Include Aaron Baggaley testimonial. Show the September surge (34 relationships, 11 bids in 30 days) as proof of peak performance. Emphasize this is replicable, systematic, not lucky.

### Case Study: Breakthrough Lighting

**Page Goal:** Demonstrate how a lighting distributor generated $10MM in pipeline and achieved growth despite 2025 market challenges.

**Big Idea Application:** Systematic, engineered outreach works even when markets freeze—because the system doesn't stop when others pull back.

**Details:** Pull from breakthrough lighting sales.md. Context: wanted 25-30% more relationships, access to bigger design-build firms and GCs, growth in uncertain market (tariffs, project holds). Approach: multi-channel (ConstructConnect, Dodge, general campaigns), project-based targeting for electrical contractors, persona-based for designers/architects, positioned as strategic partnership not vendor. Results: $10MM in pipeline attributed directly by client, $20K closed, $2MM year-over-year growth despite market turmoil, 25-30% more new relationships, 20% more opportunities. Investment: $13,500 actual. ROI: 740:1. Include Joe Pineda testimonials about thoroughness, strategic partnership, and "can't say enough good things." Highlight the "three-legged stool" framework and the persistence example (designer didn't respond until third attempt).

### Case Study: Kings Drywall

**Page Goal:** Show how a specialty contractor (drywall) generated $3MM pipeline in just 4 months with focused targeting.

**Big Idea Application:** Engineered targeting—knowing exactly which projects have your scope—delivers conversion rates 4X higher than general outreach.

**Details:** Use kings drywall sales.md. Context: drywall subcontractor wanted access to commercial GCs and residential developers. Approach: dual-market targeting (commercial + residential), project-based via ConstructConnect, systematic follow-up. Results: $3MM pipeline from $7,500 investment (400:1 ROI), 58 relationships from 950 contacts (6.11% conversion), 6 bid requests, 7 bid list additions, 10+ repeat clients. Peak performance: April's 23.40% conversion rate (11 relationships, 7 opportunities from just 47 contacts). Include Ernesto Fuentes testimonial about "really gets who we are," "long-term impact," and "should be charging more." Show the channel comparison: project-based ConstructConnect (17.65% conversion) vs. general outreach (4.45%)—4X improvement proves targeting precision matters.

### Case Study: EFI

**Page Goal:** Demonstrate channel effectiveness and conversion performance for another specialty contractor.

**Big Idea Application:** Project-based intelligence targeting active projects outperforms general outreach every time—this is engineering, not guessing.

**Details:** Draw from efi sales.md carefully—this case has strong process metrics but limited business outcome data. Focus on: dual-channel coordination (ConstructConnect + Dodge achieving 9.83% combined conversion in August peak month), 21 relationships from 365 contacts (5.75% overall), project-based outperforms general by 4.5X (7.69% vs 1.69%). Keep this shorter and more process-focused than the others, but show it validates the systematic approach. If additional outcome data becomes available (pipeline value, closed deals), incorporate it. Otherwise, position this as proof that the targeting methodology works consistently across different clients and markets.

### DBIA 2025 Landing Page

**Page Goal:** Convert conference attendees into qualified discovery calls by showing immediate relevance to design-build audience.

**Big Idea Application:** If you're at DBIA, you're already thinking about growth. Here's the engineered system that delivers it.

**Details:** Event-specific context: "Visiting from DBIA 2025?" or similar. Lead immediately with the Delta GC case study ($15.55MM pipeline for design-build contractor). Show how the system works for design-build firms specifically: access to owners and developers early in project conception, pre-positioning before teams are selected, relationship building that turns into repeat invitations. Offer: complimentary pipeline audit or growth strategy session for DBIA attendees. Include time-bound incentive if appropriate (book by X date). Keep it focused—one clear offer, one clear next step. Use the multi-stakeholder targeting angle (developers, architects, property managers, business owners) since that resonates with design-build approach.
