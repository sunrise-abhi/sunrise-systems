## The Challenge Section

**Headline:**
A drywall contractor wanted access to bigger, more profitable projects

Kings Drywall is a California-based drywall subcontractor with strong capabilities but limited access to larger commercial GCs and residential developers.

They wanted:

- Access to **bigger, more profitable commercial projects** beyond their current scope
- Relationships with **commercial GCs and residential developers** in their market
- **Predictable project flow** beyond referrals and existing relationships
- **Long-term repeat client relationships** that generate consistent work
- **Diversified pipeline** across both commercial and residential markets

Like many specialty contractors, they had the expertise to handle larger projects—they just needed to get in front of the right decision-makers.

## The Approach Section

**Headline:**
Dual-market targeting: commercial GCs + residential developers

### Project-based intelligence (ConstructConnect)

We identified active drywall projects in Kings' geographic market using ConstructConnect's database. This gave us precision targeting—we knew which projects had drywall scope and were actively bidding.

**Key advantage:** When you know a project needs drywall and is in the bidding phase, conversion rates skyrocket compared to general cold outreach.

### Dual-market strategy

Rather than focusing on just one market, we simultaneously targeted:

**Commercial GCs:** Larger projects, longer sales cycles, higher profit potential, repeat relationship opportunities

**Residential Developers:** Smaller individual projects, faster cycles, volume opportunities, consistent work flow

This diversification reduced revenue concentration risk and created a balanced, sustainable pipeline.

### Personalized outreach

Every contact received researched, customized messaging—not generic spam. We referenced specific projects, demonstrated understanding of their needs, and positioned Kings as a solution.

### Systematic follow-up

Prospects received multiple touchpoints over time, with follow-up sequences tracked in CRM to ensure no opportunities fell through the cracks.

## Client Testimonial Section

"Sunrise really gets the feeling of who we are and what we're doing. They're really going to have a long-term impact with getting us those bigger, more profitable commercial projects, and that's why I went with them over other short-term options.

They're doing a great thing and I'm happy to be working with them because I know it's money well spent… and in reality they should be charging a lot more."

**— Ernesto Fuentes, CEO, Kings Drywall LLC**

## What Made This Work Section

**Headline:**
Why this generated exceptional ROI for a specialty contractor

### Precision targeting beats volume
17.65% conversion on ConstructConnect vs. 4.45% on general outreach. When you target decision-makers on active projects with identified drywall scope, conversion economics improve exponentially.

### Dual-market diversification
Commercial GCs provide larger projects with repeat potential. Residential developers provide volume and faster cycles. Together, they create a balanced, sustainable pipeline.

### Bid list additions = recurring value
7 bid list pre-qualifications mean Kings now gets recurring bid invitations without additional outreach cost. These relationships compound over time.

### High opportunity conversion rate
24% of relationships turned into immediate opportunities (14 tangible outcomes from 58 relationships). This shows quality targeting, not just top-of-funnel vanity metrics.

### Cost efficiency
At $129 per relationship and $1,250 per bid request, Kings needs only one win to generate 10:1 profit return. The economics strongly favor this approach.

### Systematic persistence
Consistent outreach over 4 months, tracked in CRM, with systematic follow-up ensured no opportunities slipped through the cracks.

## Replicability For Specialty Contractors Section

**Headline:**
This approach works for all specialty trades

The same systematic process that worked for Kings Drywall applies to:

- **Electrical contractors:** Target GCs and developers on projects with electrical scope
- **HVAC contractors:** Identify commercial projects in bidding phase
- **Plumbing contractors:** Access GCs on active projects needing MEP trades
- **Framing contractors:** Connect with residential developers and commercial GCs
- **Any specialty trade:** If projects are tracked in ConstructConnect or Dodge, we can target decision-makers

The key is **project-based intelligence**. When you know which projects have your scope and are actively bidding, conversion rates increase 4-14X compared to spray-and-pray general outreach.
