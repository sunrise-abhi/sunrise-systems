## How the BIG IDEA Is Woven Throughout

**"Growth, engineered"** is now explicit in the hero headline, then reinforced throughout:

- **Hero:** "Growth Engineered" as the headline makes the BIG IDEA unmissable
- **Results Intro:** "systematic business development" = engineered, not accidental
- **Case Studies:** Specific conversion rates (23.40%), ROI multiples (1,457:1), and methodologies = measurable precision
- **Services:** "Three departments. One growth engine" = architected system with flexibility
- **Built for Commercial Construction:** Emphasizes construction-specific expertise and insider understanding
- **Process:** "Track in real time" = controlled, visible, measured
- **Throughout:** Project-based targeting, systematic outreach, custom technology = deliberate engineering

The BIG IDEA leads as the hero headline, making it impossible to miss. Every section that follows reinforces it through systematic language, measurable proof, and construction-specific expertise.

## Voice & Style Consistency

The copy follows the strategic brief guidelines:

✅ **Direct and benefit-first:** Hero leads with "Bid invites on projects you actually want"  
✅ **Specific metrics:** "$15.55MM" not "$15MM+" or "over $15MM"  
✅ **Active voice:** "We build," "We deliver," "We execute"  
✅ **No marketing jargon:** Zero instances of "solutions," "leverage," "synergy"  
✅ **Provable claims:** Every metric ties to documented case studies  
✅ **Contractor-to-contractor tone:** Confident peer explaining a system  
✅ **Scannable:** Short sentences, clear sections, visual hierarchy

---

## Narrative Flow

The page builds a complete argument:

**Act 1 (Hero → Stats):** The BIG IDEA → Proof at scale  
**Act 2 (Case Studies):** Proof in detail (three different contractor types)  
**Act 3 (Services):** The integrated system (with flexibility to choose)  
**Act 4 (Process → Specialization → CTA):** How to start → Why we're different → Take the next step

Each section reinforces credibility and removes objections:
- Skeptical about promises? See specific metrics from real contractors.
- Wondering if it works for your trade? See three different contractor types succeeding.
- Curious how it works? See the three-department system working together.
- Worried about big upfront commitment? Choose what fits your needs and budget.
- Concerned it's generic marketing? See construction-specific expertise and process.
- Unsure about next step? Simple discovery call with clear path forward.

## Key Differentiators Emphasized

1. **Concrete deliverable:** Bid invites (not vague "brand awareness")
2. **Systematic approach:** Project-based targeting using ConstructConnect/Dodge
3. **Integrated system with flexibility:** Three departments working together, choose what fits
4. **Measurable results:** Specific ROI, conversion rates, pipeline values
5. **Proof across contexts:** GC, distributor, specialty contractor all succeeding
6. **Construction-specific expertise:** Built for how commercial projects actually get bid and won
7. **Low-risk entry:** Discovery call, not big commitment

---

## Success Criteria Met

✅ Copy sounds like confident expert speaking to another expert  
✅ Every section reinforces "Growth, engineered" through systematic positioning  
✅ Three services presented as integrated system, not menu  
✅ Metrics specific and verifiable (all tie to case study documentation)  
✅ Voice matches strategic brief and sales sheets exactly  
✅ Copy is scannable and direct—no fluff, nothing wasted  
✅ Clear conversion path throughout (discovery call)

## Next Steps

**For Review:**
1. Read through the complete copy in `/assets/website/website-copy/home.md`
2. Check if tone matches your expectations for the brand
3. Verify case study metrics align with latest data
4. Confirm the integrated system positioning resonates
5. Assess if the BIG IDEA comes through implicitly

**Questions for Discussion:**
- Does the hero headline hit immediately, or should we test alternatives?
- Are the case study headlines leading with the right metrics?
- Does the services intro make integration clear enough?
- Is the process section simple enough, or too simple?
- Any specific phrases or sections that feel off-brand?

**Potential Iterations:**
- Test alternative hero headlines if current doesn't feel strong enough
- Adjust case study emphasis based on which resonates most
- Refine services descriptions if integration isn't clear
- Modify CTA language if tone feels off
