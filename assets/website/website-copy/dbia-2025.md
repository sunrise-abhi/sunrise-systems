## Why This Works For Design-Build Section

**Headline:**
Multi-stakeholder targeting built for design-build

Design-build firms don't just need to connect with GCs—you need access to the entire project ecosystem.

Our systematic approach targets all the decision-makers who matter:

### Developers
Direct project owners with budget authority. Early access means positioning before teams are selected.

### Architects
Influencers who recommend design-build firms for their projects. Upstream influence over who gets invited.

### Property Managers
Recurring revenue source for maintenance, renovation, and tenant improvement work.

### Business Owners
Decision-makers on commercial renovation, fire rebuild, and build-out projects.

This multi-stakeholder approach creates multiple entry points into projects and turns one-time bids into repeat relationships.

## How It Works Section

**Headline:**
Systematic business development for design-build firms

### 1. Project intelligence

We use ConstructConnect and Dodge to identify active projects in your market that match your capabilities—before bid lists close.

### 2. Multi-stakeholder outreach

We reach developers, architects, property managers, and business owners with personalized, researched outreach. Not spray-and-pray cold email.

### 3. Pre-positioning

We position you as the preferred choice early in the project cycle—at conception stage or before final teams are selected.

### 4. Relationship building

Every conversation, follow-up, and result is tracked in your CRM. Systematic follow-up turns initial contacts into long-term partnerships.

### 5. Qualified opportunities

Bid invites flow into your pipeline. You stay focused on design and building—we handle the relationship development.

## Results You Can Expect Section

**Headline:**
What design-build firms achieve with systematic BD

**Immediate pipeline growth**
Qualified bid opportunities start flowing within 30-60 days of campaign launch

**Access to bigger projects**
Bid list additions with developers and property managers open doors to recurring opportunities

**Higher conversion rates**
Project-based targeting delivers 3-8X higher engagement than general cold outreach

**Long-term relationships**
25-50% of conversations turn into repeat client relationships beyond the initial project

**Measurable ROI**
Track every dollar invested and every opportunity generated. Growth should be systematic and measurable—not guesswork.

## Peak Performance Example Section

**Headline:**
September surge: 34 relationships and 11 bid requests in 30 days

During September's coordinated outreach campaign for Delta, multi-stakeholder targeting produced exceptional results:

**Dodge Owners Campaign:**
- 195 contacts → 25 relationships (12.82% conversion)
- 9 direct bid/quote requests

**ConstructConnect Architects Campaign:**
- 15 contacts → 2 relationships (13.33% conversion)

**Combined September Performance:**
- 34 total decision-maker relationships
- 11 direct bid/quote requests

This demonstrates the explosive potential when you target multiple stakeholders simultaneously during active project windows.

## FAQ Section

**Headline:**
Common questions from DBIA attendees

**Q: How is this different from traditional BD or marketing agencies?**

We don't do brand awareness campaigns or "exposure." We deliver qualified bid invites on active projects using project intelligence databases (ConstructConnect, Dodge). You get measurable opportunities, not vanity metrics.

**Q: Will this work in my specific market?**

If projects are tracked in ConstructConnect or Dodge, we can generate opportunities. We've delivered results for contractors in California, Texas, Arizona, and other markets. Your pipeline audit will show exactly what's available in your area.

**Q: How long before we see results?**

Most clients receive their first bid requests within 30-60 days. Pipeline starts building immediately, but conversion to closed work depends on your sales cycle.

**Q: What's the investment?**

Typical engagements range from $1,500-$3,000/month depending on scope and market size. ROI averages 865:1 pipeline multiple across all clients.

**Q: Do we need to commit long-term?**

No. We recommend 3-6 months to build momentum, but we're focused on proving value—not locking you into contracts. If it's working, you'll want to continue. If not, you shouldn't.

**Q: How do you integrate with our existing sales process?**

We feed opportunities into your CRM and existing workflow. Think of us as an extension of your team—we generate the relationships, you handle the estimating and closing.
