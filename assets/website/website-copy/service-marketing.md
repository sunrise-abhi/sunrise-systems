# Branding & Marketing

## Hero Section

**Headline:**
Position yourself as the contractor GCs want to work with

**Subheadline:**
Your next project isn't won on price—it's won on reputation. We help you build the premium digital presence and brand positioning that attracts better projects and stronger relationships with the right decision-makers.

## The Reality Section

**Stats Block:**

92% of GCs and developers research contractors online before reaching out

2-3x more qualified opportunities for contractors with consistent digital presence

---

## The Problem Section

**Headline:**
Most construction marketing is stuck in 2010

Generic "conversion-optimized" websites that all look the same. Sporadic social posts that don't hit the mark. Hype videos that don't actually generate projects.

Meanwhile, the contractors winning the best work have something different: premium positioning that makes them the obvious choice, not the cheapest option.

When a developer or GC researches you online, what do they find? A website that builds confidence or raises questions? A LinkedIn presence that positions expertise or radio silence? Content that demonstrates capability or corporate fluff?

The bar is low. That's your opportunity.

## Why This Matters Section

**Headline:**
Premium positioning changes what you're competing on

When you're positioned as a premium choice, you're no longer competing on price. You're competing on expertise, reliability, and the confidence that you'll deliver exceptional work.

GCs and developers will pay more to work with contractors they trust. But trust requires visibility, credibility, and consistent presence.

That's what strategic marketing builds.

Marketing that drives real opportunities

### Breakthrough Lighting: Complete rebrand positions distributor as strategic partner

We launched a complete rebrand for Breakthrough Lighting, transforming how they present themselves to electrical contractors, designers, and architects.

The positioning shift—from vendor to strategic partner—helped them access larger design-build firms and generate $10MM in qualified pipeline.

"Sunrise are very thorough in their methods—they're not going to leave any stone unturned so that they can craft the best possible message for your target customers."

## What You Get Section

**Headline:**
The combination that works

**Brand positioning + professional design + strategic content = consistent visibility with the right decision-makers**

This isn't about looking pretty. It's about being remembered when projects arise, building confidence before the first conversation, and positioning yourself to win the work you actually want.

Where others deliver generic marketing tactics, we build integrated systems:
- Your brand positions the value
- Your website proves the capability
- Your content maintains the relationships
- Your LinkedIn keeps you visible

Together, these create the premium presence that attracts better opportunities.
