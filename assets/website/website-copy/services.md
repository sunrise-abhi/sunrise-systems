We deliver the three systems commercial contractors need to scale: sales that generates opportunities, marketing that positions you for them, and software that makes it all systematic.

## Why All Three Section

**Headline:**
Growth requires all three working together

Most contractors have one, maybe two of these. But sustainable growth requires all three as a unified system.

**Sales without positioning** gets you bid invites on projects you'll lose to better-branded competitors.

**Marketing without sales** builds your reputation but doesn't fill your pipeline with opportunities right now.

**Systems without strategy** just automates the wrong process faster.

We build all three as an integrated engine—each component amplifying the others.

### Marketing

**Premium positioning that wins you the projects you bid**

Your next project isn't won on price—it's won on reputation. We build the brand presence and digital positioning that makes GCs and developers want to work with you.

**What you get:**
- Brand messaging that differentiates you from commodity bidders
- Website redesign that builds immediate credibility
- LinkedIn and newsletter strategy that keeps you top-of-mind
- Content that positions you as the expert, not just another option

**Results:**
We launched a complete rebrand for Breakthrough Lighting that positioned them as a strategic partner, not a vendor. Our clients report being invited to bid on larger, more profitable projects after establishing premium positioning.

**Custom technology that systematizes your operations**

Off-the-shelf software forces you to adapt to its workflow. We build technology around how you actually operate—giving you visibility, automation, and control.

- Legacy database modernization and data extraction
- Custom CRM systems that replace bloated platforms like Procore
- Automated workflows for sales, marketing, and project tracking
- AI-powered tools built for construction operations

**Results:**
We extracted one client's 1994-2007 project database and migrated it to the cloud, recovering thousands of valuable contacts. Our proprietary operations system gives every client real-time visibility into pipeline, outreach activity, and marketing performance.

## The System In Action

**Headline:**
Here's how it works together

**Example Scenario:**

Our sales team identifies an active $5MM commercial project in your market and reaches out to the developer. Your brand positioning—professional website, active LinkedIn presence, clear differentiation—makes you stand out from the 47 other contractors they could choose.

The developer adds you to their bid list. Our CRM automatically logs this, triggers follow-up sequences, and alerts your estimating team. The opportunity moves through your pipeline with full visibility.

You win the bid. The system captures the relationship, tracks project milestones, and schedules long-term follow-ups to turn this into repeat business.

Six months later, the same developer has another project. You're already in their network, already proven, already top-of-mind. You get the call before it goes to public bid.

That's engineered growth.

## Who This Is For

**Commercial contractors and design-build firms** who want predictable project flow beyond referrals

**Specialty trades and subcontractors** who need access to GCs and developers on active projects

**Construction suppliers and distributors** looking to generate consistent bid opportunities with electrical contractors, GCs, and design firms

If you're doing $2MM–$100MM in revenue and want to scale without destroying your margins or taking every project that comes along, this system is built for you.
