## The Challenge Section

**Headline:**
A design-build GC wanted predictable pipeline beyond referrals

Delta Construction & Electric Co. is a design-build general contractor with a strong reputation in their market. Like many successful contractors, they built their business on relationships and referrals.

But referrals aren't scalable. They wanted:

- Consistent flow of qualified opportunities alongside their existing relationships
- Direct access to developers, architects, property managers, and business owners
- Pre-positioning on high-value projects before bid lists closed
- Long-term relationships that turn into repeat business
- Measurable, systematic business development they could track and scale

They needed a partner who could deliver qualified bid invites without the spray-and-pray approach they associated with traditional "sales."

## The Approach Section

**Headline:**
Multi-stakeholder targeting across the project ecosystem

Rather than targeting just one type of decision-maker, we built a systematic approach that engaged the complete spectrum of commercial construction stakeholders.

### Project-based intelligence

We used ConstructConnect and Dodge to identify active projects that matched Delta's capabilities and geographic market. This gave us early visibility into opportunities before final bid lists closed.

### Multi-stakeholder outreach

We simultaneously targeted four buyer personas:
- **Developers:** Direct project owners with budget authority
- **Architects:** Influencers who recommend GCs for their projects
- **Property Managers:** Recurring revenue source for maintenance and renovation work
- **Business Owners:** Decision-makers on fire rebuild and commercial renovation projects

This diversified approach created multiple entry points into projects and reduced dependency on any single channel.

### Account-based relationship building

Each prospect received researched, personalized outreach—not generic templates. We referenced specific projects, demonstrated value upfront, and focused on long-term partnership development rather than pushy sales tactics.

### Systematic pipeline management

Every conversation, follow-up, and result was tracked in Delta's CRM system. This gave them real-time visibility into who was interested, which opportunities were heating up, and where to focus their estimating resources.

## What Made This Work Section

**Headline:**
Why this generated exceptional results

### Systematic, not random
Every contact was researched. Every message was personalized. Every follow-up was tracked. This wasn't spray-and-pray cold email—it was intelligent, systematic relationship building.

### Multi-stakeholder diversification
By targeting developers, architects, property managers, and business owners simultaneously, we created multiple paths into projects and reduced single-channel risk.

### Project-based intelligence
Using ConstructConnect and Dodge gave us early visibility into active projects, allowing us to position Delta before final decisions were made.

### Long-term focus
We weren't just generating one-time bids. We identified 25+ repeat client relationships that will generate recurring opportunities for years.

### Integration with existing operations
We didn't replace Delta's internal team—we augmented it. Our outreach integrated seamlessly with their existing CRM and estimating workflow.

## Replicability Section

**Headline:**
This is systematic and replicable

These results weren't luck. They're the outcome of a proven process:

1. Identify active projects using commercial construction databases
2. Target decision-makers across multiple stakeholder types
3. Deliver personalized, value-focused outreach
4. Track everything in CRM for full pipeline visibility
5. Nurture relationships with systematic follow-up
6. Convert conversations into bid invites and repeat relationships

This same approach has generated similar results for other commercial contractors, specialty trades, and construction suppliers.

The system works because it's engineered—not improvised.
