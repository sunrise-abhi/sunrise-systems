# Home Page Strategic Brief

## Page Goal

Convert qualified commercial contractors into discovery calls by immediately proving Sunrise delivers tangible business development results—not marketing promises. The home page must establish credibility in seconds, demonstrate the integrated system approach, and create urgency to engage.

Primary conversion: Schedule discovery call
Secondary conversion: Explore case studies or services

---

## BIG IDEA Application: "Growth, engineered"

The home page is where "Growth, engineered" becomes concrete and undeniable.

Every element reinforces that growth here is:
- **Systematic** (project-based targeting, not spray-and-pray)
- **Measurable** (specific metrics: $15.55MM pipeline, 1,457:1 ROI, not vague "results")
- **Engineered** (three integrated services working as a system, not scattered tactics)

The page must feel like precision machinery—each section builds proof, demonstrates methodology, and shows the path forward. No fluffy mission statements. No abstract value propositions. Just outcomes, process, and invitation to start.

**How it manifests:**
- Hero: Lead with the outcome (bid invites on projects you want)
- Case studies: Show the engineering through specific numbers and conversion rates
- Services: Present as integrated architecture (sales finds opportunities, marketing positions you, software systemizes it)
- Process: Demonstrate the systematic approach in three clear steps
- Throughout: Use language of precision, measurement, and deliberate design

## Target Audience Positioning

**Primary:** Ambitious commercial contractors doing $2MM-$100MM revenue who want predictable pipeline growth beyond referrals

**Psychographic:**
- Growth-minded but skeptical (burned by marketing agencies before)
- Values proof over promises
- Respects systems and measurement (construction mindset)
- Time-constrained (needs clarity, not complexity)
- Ready to invest if ROI is demonstrable

**What they need to believe after reading this page:**
1. Sunrise delivers actual bid invites, not just "brand awareness"
2. The approach is systematic and replicable (not luck)
3. The three services work together as a growth engine
4. The results are specific, verifiable, and achievable
5. The next step is clear and low-risk (discovery call)

**Tone for this audience:**
Confident peer-to-peer. Like a successful contractor explaining their system to another contractor. Direct. Economical with words. Respects their intelligence. Proves claims with numbers.

## Messaging Hierarchy & Flow

**Act 1: Immediate Proof (Hero → Stats)**
- Open with the concrete outcome they want (bid invites)
- Immediately back it with aggregate proof (pipeline generated, ROI)
- Establish credibility before explaining anything

**Act 2: Specific Evidence (Case Studies)**
- Show three different contractor types achieving results
- Each case study = proof the system works across contexts
- Metrics must be specific enough to be believable

**Act 3: The System (Services)**
- Position as integrated architecture, not à la carte menu
- Show how the three pieces create the outcomes from Act 2
- Sales = opportunities, Marketing = positioning, Software = systematization

**Act 4: The Path (Process + CTA)**
- Demystify how to start (three simple steps)
- Remove friction with clear next action
- Reinforce low-risk entry (discovery call, not commitment)

**Narrative arc:**
"Here's what you get → Here's proof it works → Here's how it works → Here's how to start"

## Tone & Voice Guidelines by Section

**Hero:**
Punchy. Benefit-first. No preamble. State what they get in 10 words or less. Subhead adds the "how" (systematic approach) without getting abstract.

**Case Studies:**
Let the numbers speak. Headlines emphasize outcomes ($15.55MM) or efficiency (1,457:1 ROI). Subheads provide just enough context to make it credible. Metrics are specific (not "$10MM+" but "$10MM").

**Services:**
Functional. Each service is a component of the system. Describe what it does (verb-oriented), not what it is (noun-oriented). "Get bid invites on active projects" beats "Lead generation services."

**Process:**
Simple. No jargon. Three steps should feel obvious and achievable. Avoid overselling ("revolutionary process") or underselling ("easy 3-step system"). Just state the steps.

**CTA:**
Direct invitation. No hype. "Ready to scale your pipeline?" beats "Transform your business today!" Subhead removes objection (one call, not a big commitment).

## Key Differentiators to Emphasize

1. **Deliverable is concrete:** Bid invites, not "brand awareness"
2. **Approach is systematic:** Project-based targeting using ConstructConnect/Dodge
3. **Results are measurable:** Specific pipeline values, conversion rates, ROI multiples
4. **Services are integrated:** Three components working as one system
5. **Proof is specific:** Real contractors, real numbers, real attributions
6. **Team understands construction:** Not generic marketers trying to "disrupt" the industry

**What NOT to emphasize:**
- Technology for technology's sake (it's a tool, not the value)
- Agency credentials or awards (they care about results, not our resume)
- "Revolutionizing" or "disrupting" construction (they want reliable, not trendy)

## Section-Specific Strategic Notes

**Hero:**
The headline must pass the "3-second test"—if they read nothing else, they know what you deliver. "Bid invites on projects you actually want" is outcome-focused and immediately relevant.

**Results Intro:**
Frame the case studies as proof for skeptics. "Real results from contractors like you" acknowledges their skepticism and answers it with specificity.

**Case Study Headlines:**
Lead with the most impressive metric. For Delta: the $15.55MM or 1,457:1 ROI. For Breakthrough: the $10MM attribution or market resilience. For Kings: the 400:1 ROI or 23.40% conversion.

**Services Intro:**
Must explicitly position as integrated system. "Three components. One growth engine." or similar. Avoid letting them think à la carte.

**How It Works:**
Keep it simple enough that they feel confident starting. Discovery → Strategy → Results. Nothing complicated. Shows you understand their time constraints.

**CTA:**
Remove friction. "One call" emphasizes low commitment. "Ready to scale your pipeline?" is benefit-focused question (not "Want to learn more?").

## Success Metrics for Copy

If the copy works, readers will:
1. Immediately understand what Sunrise delivers (bid invites, pipeline)
2. Believe the results are achievable (specific proof, not vague claims)
3. See the three services as one system (not pick-and-choose menu)
4. Feel confident the approach is systematic (engineering mindset resonates)
5. Know exactly what to do next (schedule call)

If the copy fails, readers will:
- Think it's another marketing agency making promises
- Wonder if the results are cherry-picked or exaggerated
- Get confused about which service to choose
- Feel uncertain about the process or methodology
- Leave without clear next action

## Writing Checklist

Before finalizing any section, verify:
- [ ] Does it lead with outcome, not process?
- [ ] Are metrics specific (not ranges or "up to")?
- [ ] Is the voice direct and confident (peer-to-peer)?
- [ ] Does it avoid marketing jargon and fluff?
- [ ] Can every claim be proven with case study data?
- [ ] Does it reinforce "Growth, engineered" implicitly?
- [ ] Would a skeptical contractor find it credible?

This strategic brief serves as the foundation for all home page copy decisions. Every word should serve the goal: convert qualified contractors by proving Sunrise delivers systematic, measurable business development results.
