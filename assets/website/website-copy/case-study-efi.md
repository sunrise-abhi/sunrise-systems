## What This Proves Section

**Headline:**
The methodology works consistently across clients

The EFI campaign validates several critical principles:

### Project intelligence matters more than volume

7.69% conversion with project context vs. 1.69% without it. When you know someone has an active project that needs your scope, they're 4.5X more likely to engage.

### Dual-channel coordination amplifies results

Running ConstructConnect and Dodge simultaneously increased conversion rates because decision-makers saw outreach from multiple credible sources.

### Systematic persistence pays off

The 5.75% overall conversion (21 relationships from 365 contacts) proves that even "cold" outreach generates warm relationships when done with research, personalization, and persistence.

### Bid lists create recurring value

The 2 bid list additions secured during this campaign give EFI ongoing access to future opportunities without additional outreach cost.

## Replicability Section

**Headline:**
This systematic approach scales across specialty trades

If you're a specialty contractor, this same methodology applies to your market:

1. Identify active projects using ConstructConnect or Dodge
2. Filter for projects that match your scope and capabilities
3. Research decision-makers (GCs, developers, owners)
4. Deliver personalized outreach referencing specific projects
5. Track everything in CRM for systematic follow-up
6. Convert conversations into bid invites and bid list additions

The system works because it's based on project intelligence, not guesswork.
