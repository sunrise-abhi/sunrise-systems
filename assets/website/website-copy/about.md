## Company Story Section

**Headline:**
Building for 2030

Most construction marketing agencies are stuck in 2010. Generic websites, sporadic social posts, hype videos that don't generate projects.

We started Sunrise Systems in 2024 to build something different: a growth partner that combines world-class sales, strategic marketing, and custom software into one integrated system—built specifically for commercial construction.

Founded by three partners with backgrounds in software development, agency operations, and enterprise systems, we bootstrapped from $3K to $29K in monthly revenue in eight months. We did it by proving results first, then scaling what works.

We don't do retainer contracts where you pay for "exposure" and "brand awareness." We deliver qualified bid invites, measurable pipeline growth, and technology that gives you operational visibility.

Every tool we use, we built ourselves. Every process we implement for clients, we've tested internally. Every metric we track, we can prove.

That's the difference between a marketing vendor and a growth partner.

## Philosophy Section

**Headline:**
Growth, engineered

We treat business development the way contractors treat construction: systematically, measurably, professionally.

**Clarity:** We simplify complexity so our clients can make smart decisions and move forward with confidence.

**Ownership:** We treat our clients' businesses like our own, bringing care, honesty, and accountability to everything we do.

**Results:** We build systems and strategies that don't just look good—they drive measurable, lasting growth.

Word of mouth and referrals built your business. But they won't scale it. Sustainable growth requires systematic sales, strategic positioning, and operational technology working together.

That's what we engineer.

## Our Approach Section

**Headline:**
How we work with clients

We don't believe in long sales cycles, complicated proposals, or contracts that lock you in for a year before proving value.

**We start with a discovery call.** Understand your current pipeline, identify opportunities in your market, and show you exactly how we can help you grow.

**We build a custom strategy.** Combining sales outreach, marketing positioning, and technology solutions specific to your trade, region, and growth goals.

**We deliver results immediately.** Our team gets to work building relationships with local GCs and developers, positioning your brand, and setting up systems that deliver consistent opportunities.

**We track everything.** Every bid invite, every relationship, every dollar of pipeline value. You'll always know exactly what's working and what ROI you're getting.

**We scale what works.** When something's generating results, we do more of it. When something's not, we adjust. Growth should be systematic and measurable—not guesswork.

## Why Commercial Construction Section

**Headline:**
We only work with commercial construction companies

Commercial construction is different from residential. The sales cycles are longer. The relationships matter more. The decision-makers are sophisticated.

You can't use the same marketing tactics that work for home improvement contractors. GCs and developers don't respond to Facebook ads and Google Local Services. They respond to credibility, relationships, and demonstrated expertise.

That's why we specialize exclusively in commercial construction. We understand your market, we speak your language, and we know what actually generates opportunities in this industry.

Our clients include:
- Design-build general contractors
- Specialty trade contractors (electrical, drywall, HVAC, plumbing)
- Construction suppliers and distributors
- Commercial contractors expanding into new markets

If you're in commercial construction and you're serious about growth, we're built for you.
