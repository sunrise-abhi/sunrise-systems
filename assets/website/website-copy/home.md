## Copy Annotations

**How each section ties to "Growth, engineered":**

**Hero:** The headline IS the BIG IDEA made explicit. Subhead immediately reinforces it by describing the systematic, integrated approach (sales + marketing + technology working together).

**Results Intro:** Sets up proof with language emphasizing systematic approach ("systematic business development"). Frames case studies as evidence the engineering works across different contractor types.

**Case Studies:** Each demonstrates precision through specific metrics. Delta shows multi-stakeholder engineering. Breakthrough shows resilience through systematic consistency. Kings shows efficiency through targeted intelligence (23.40% conversion = precision, not volume).

**Services Intro:** Explicitly positions as engineered system ("Three departments. One growth engine."). Shows how teams work together while giving flexibility to choose what fits their needs. Maintains integration message while removing barrier to entry.

**Individual Services:** Each described functionally (what it does) with engineering language. Sales = "project-based targeting." Marketing = "positioning strategy." Software = "systematic and scalable."

**How It Works:** Shows the engineering of the process itself. Three clear steps = methodical approach. "Track in real time" = measurable, visible, controlled.

**Built for Commercial Construction:** Establishes specialization and expertise. Reinforces that the engineering is construction-specific (not generic marketing adapted for construction). "How projects actually get bid and won" = insider understanding of the industry.

**CTA:** Low-friction invitation that emphasizes seeing "how systematic business development works"—reinforcing the engineered approach one final time.

## Page Flow Summary

The page builds a complete narrative:

1. **Open with the BIG IDEA** (Growth Engineered headline + systematic approach)
2. **Prove it works** (three case studies with specific metrics)
3. **Show the system** (three departments working together, with flexibility)
4. **Clarify the path** (three steps to start)
5. **Establish specialization** (built for commercial construction)
6. **Invite action** (one call to see how it works for you)

Every section reinforces that growth here is:
- **Deliberate** (project-based targeting, not spray-and-pray)
- **Measurable** (specific pipeline values, conversion rates, ROI multiples)
- **Systematic** (three services working as integrated architecture)
- **Achievable** (real contractors, recent timeframes, clear process)

The language throughout avoids marketing clichés and speaks contractor-to-contractor. Numbers are specific. Claims are verifiable. The voice is confident but never boastful. The BIG IDEA ("Growth, engineered") leads as the hero headline, then is reinforced implicitly through every section that follows.

The new "Built for Commercial Construction" section addresses a key differentiator: this isn't generic marketing adapted for construction—it's business development engineered specifically for how commercial projects get bid and won.

A skeptical contractor reading this page should walk away thinking: "These people understand business development as a system built for my industry. They have proof it works. I can choose what fits my needs. The next step is clear."

That's the engineering of the copy itself.
