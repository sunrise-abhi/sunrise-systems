### $3MM in pipeline for a drywall subcontractor in 4 months

"Sunrise really gets the feeling of who we are and what we're doing. They're really going to have a long-term impact with getting us those bigger, more profitable commercial projects, and that's why I went with them over other short-term options.

They're doing a great thing and I'm happy to be working with them because I know it's money well spent… and in reality they should be charging a lot more."
