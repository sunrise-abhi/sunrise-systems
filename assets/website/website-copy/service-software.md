# Custom Software Development

## Hero Section

**Headline:**
Custom technology built for construction operations

**Subheadline:**
Your business has unique operational challenges that off-the-shelf software can't solve.

We build custom technology that brings your vision to life—whether that's replacing bloated systems like Procore, modernizing decades-old databases, or creating centralized dashboards that show exactly what you need to see (and nothing you don't).

---

## The Problem Section

**Headline:**
Off-the-shelf software forces you to adapt to its workflow

You're managing millions in projects across tools that were never built for how you actually operate. Information gets buried, updates fall behind, and opportunities are missed because there's no clear view of what's happening.

Procore is overkill for most contractors. Monday.com doesn't understand construction. Excel spreadsheets become unmaintainable. Email inboxes become project databases.

You need technology that works the way you work—not the other way around.

## The Solution Section

**Headline:**
We build software around your operations

Our entire founding team has software development backgrounds. We don't just set up CRM systems—we architect, design, and build custom technology that solves your specific operational problems.

### Central operations system

**One dashboard, tailored to your entire operation**

Every Sunrise client gets our proprietary Central Operations system—but we customize it to fit your specific needs. Whether you need visibility into marketing efforts or want to replace your entire tech stack with a custom portal, we build it around how you actually operate.

- Real-time operational visibility into marketing campaigns, outreach activity, and project status
- Role-based customization so employees, partners, and clients see exactly what they need (nothing more)
- Unified pipeline management that combines estimating and project tracking in one place

---

### Legacy system modernization

**Unlock decades of valuable project history**

That old database from the 1990s? The contact list buried in dead email accounts? We extract it and modernize it.

- Database recovery from outdated systems (1990s-2000s software, inaccessible formats)
- Dormant contact reactivation by mining old inboxes and re-engaging past relationships
- Cloud migration that turns legacy data into modern, searchable records

**Case study:** We extracted a client's 1994-2007 project database, migrated it to the cloud, and recovered thousands of valuable contacts from past projects.

---

### AI and automation tools

**Technology built to handle your busy work**

We build artificial intelligence tools and automated systems that handle repetitive work, so your team focuses on relationships and revenue.

- Automated re-engagement campaigns that revive dormant client relationships
- Custom scripts for email mining, contact curation, and account-based outreach
- Intelligent workflows that trigger follow-ups based on project milestones or client behavior

---

### Custom CRM and project management

**Replace bloated platforms with exactly what you need**

From Procore replacements to custom dashboards to legacy system recovery—we build technology that matches your workflow instead of forcing you to change it.

- Custom CRM tailored to construction business development
- Project tracking integrated with sales pipeline
- Reporting dashboards that show ROI, pipeline health, and team activity
- Mobile-friendly interfaces for field teams and estimators

## Our Internal Systems Section

**Headline:**
We use the same technology we build for clients

Our proprietary tools power our own operations—and we give clients access to the same systems:

**OutreachSphere:** Internal CRM and lead outreach platform for contact tracking, email campaigns, and conversion visibility

**ContentSphere:** AI-assisted platform for drafting newsletters, LinkedIn posts, SEO content, and web copy

**C0 (Central Operations):** Our dashboard for client onboarding, service delivery, tasking, invoicing, and reporting—including executive, team member, and client views

These aren't off-the-shelf tools we configured. We built them from scratch because nothing else solved our specific operational needs.

That's the same approach we take for your business.

## Why Custom Software Section

**Headline:**
The right technology creates operational leverage

When software fits your exact workflow, your team stops fighting the system and starts using it naturally. Data flows where it needs to go. Reports show what actually matters. Manual processes become automatic.

That's the difference between software that gets in the way and software that creates leverage.

Most contractors can't afford a full-time development team. But you can afford us—and we bring the same level of technical expertise at a fraction of the cost.

## Results Section

**Headline:**
Technology that solves real problems

### Legacy database recovery and modernization

**Extracted 13 years of project history from a 1994-era database**

A client had decades of valuable project data trapped in an outdated system they could no longer access. We extracted the complete database, migrated it to modern cloud infrastructure, and recovered thousands of past client contacts.

Result: Immediate access to 13 years of project history, re-engagement of dormant relationships, and a foundation for data-driven decision making.

---

### Custom operations dashboard

**Replaced fragmented tools with unified system**

Client was managing sales pipeline in one tool, marketing in another, project tracking in spreadsheets, and reporting manually. We built a centralized operations system that unified everything.

Result: Real-time visibility across all operations, automated reporting, role-based access for team members and clients, 15+ hours per week saved on manual reporting.

---

### Automated outreach and follow-up system

**Built AI-powered relationship management**

Client needed systematic follow-up on hundreds of prospects but couldn't afford full-time SDRs. We built automated engagement sequences with AI-powered personalization.

Result: 200+ prospects receiving systematic touchpoints, zero manual effort, 18% engagement rate on automated follow-ups.

## What You Get Section

**Headline:**
Technology built for how you actually operate

We don't start with technology. We start with your operational challenges:

**What information do you need to see?**
**Where is data currently getting lost?**
**What manual processes are slowing your team down?**
**What would make your life easier?**

Then we build the technology that solves those specific problems.

This isn't consulting where we hand you a requirements document and disappear. We design it, build it, test it, deploy it, and support it.

---

## Who This Is For Section

**Headline:**
Built for contractors ready to modernize operations

This is for construction companies who:

- Are frustrated with bloated, expensive platforms like Procore
- Have valuable data trapped in legacy systems
- Want visibility across sales, marketing, and operations
- Need automation to scale without hiring more administrative staff
- Are ready to invest in technology that actually solves problems

If you're managing multi-million dollar projects but still tracking opportunities in spreadsheets, we should talk.
