**Headline:**
What you should notice about these numbers

### The ROI is measurable

Every case study shows exact investment amount, pipeline generated, and ROI multiple. We track everything because growth should be measurable—not guesswork.

### The timeline is fast

Delta generated $15.55MM in 8 months. Kings generated $3MM in 4 months. Breakthrough generated $10MM in 9 months. These aren't 2-year "brand building" campaigns—these are immediate results.

### The conversion rates are high

Kings: 23.40% peak conversion. Delta: 12.82% on Dodge campaigns. EFI: 9.83% in peak month. Industry average for cold outreach is 1-3%. We're delivering 3-8X higher engagement because we target decision-makers on active projects.

### The relationships are real

These aren't email clicks or "leads." These are confirmed conversations with GCs, developers, and owners who have active projects. Direct bid requests. Bid list additions. Discovery calls scheduled. Repeat client relationships secured.

### The clients are diverse

Design-build GCs, drywall subcontractors, lighting distributors. Different trades, different markets, different company sizes. The systematic approach works across the commercial construction industry.
