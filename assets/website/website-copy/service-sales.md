# Lead Generation & Sales Support

## Hero Section

**Headline:**
Get bid invites on your ideal projects every week

**Subheadline:**
Unsteady project flow? Losing to inferior competitors? Stuck bidding on projects where the decision's already made?

We put your business in front of decision-makers on active projects that match your capabilities—before bid lists close.

## The Problem Section

**Headline:**
Most contractors are playing the wrong game

You're waiting for bid invites on projects where GCs have already chosen their team. You're losing opportunities because developers don't know you exist. You're bidding against 12 other contractors on projects where price is the only differentiator.

Meanwhile, the projects you actually want—the ones where your expertise matters, where margins are healthy, where you'd deliver your best work—are going to contractors who got there first.

Word of mouth and referrals built your business. But they won't scale it.

## The Solution Section

**Headline:**
Systematic outreach that generates qualified opportunities

We blend account-based marketing with project intelligence to position you as the preferred choice on high-value projects in your market.

### Pre-positioning and market access

**We connect you with decision-makers before they choose their team**

We identify upcoming projects early using databases like ConstructConnect and Dodge, then position you as the preferred choice—whether it's at the conception stage or before the final bid list closes.

- Early project identification for opportunities that fit your scope
- Direct access to GCs, developers, and owners at every project stage
- Long-term partnership development that turns one-time bids into repeat invitations

---

### Account-based outreach

**Personalized relationship building**

We research each prospect thoroughly and craft messaging that opens doors instead of getting ignored.

- Multi-channel engagement through LinkedIn, email, and strategic outreach
- Decision-maker targeting so you connect with actual project owners and GCs
- Trust-building messaging focused on long-term partnerships, not pushy sales

---

### Pipeline management

**All leads and conversations in one place**

Your opportunities won't get lost in email threads or forgotten follow-ups. We integrate everything into your CRM system.

- Automated lead tracking from first contact through bid invitation
- Follow-up sequences that nurture relationships until projects are ready
- Pipeline visibility so you can see exactly which opportunities are heating up
