# Home Page Copy - Revision Changelog

## Changes Made Based on Feedback

### 1. Hero Section
**Original:**
- Headline: "Bid invites on projects you actually want"
- Subhead: Two sentences ending with "You choose the projects. We deliver the opportunities."

**Updated:**
- Headline: "Growth Engineered" ✅
- Subhead: One sentence, more natural flow starting with "We deliver..."
- Dropped the final two sentences for cleaner entry

**Reasoning:** Makes the BIG IDEA explicit and unmissable. Gentler, more natural introduction.

### 2. Results Intro
**Original:**
- Headline: "Results from commercial contractors like you"
- Subhead: Ended with em dash "—not luck"

**Updated:**
- Headline: "Real results for contractors like you" ✅
- Subhead: Cleaner ending at "systematic business development" (dropped "not luck")

**Reasoning:** "For" is more direct than "from." Removed the em dash that felt awkward hanging at the end.

---

### 3. Services Intro
**Original:**
- Headline: "Three components. One growth engine."
- Subhead: Short, functional descriptions without flexibility message

**Updated:**
- Headline: "Three departments. One growth engine." ✅
- Subhead: More natural language ("Our sales team... our marketing team... our software team")
- Added: "Choose what works for your needs and budget"

**Reasoning:** "Departments" feels more human than "components." Natural language flows better. Added flexibility to reduce barrier to entry while maintaining integration message.

---

### 4. New Section Added
**Section 11: Built for Commercial Construction**

**Content:**
- Headline: "Built for commercial construction"
- Two-sentence subhead establishing specialization and expertise
- Emphasizes construction-specific process, not generic marketing

**Placement:** Between "How It Works" (Section 10) and CTA (now Section 12)

**Reasoning:** Addresses key differentiator that the process is built specifically for commercial construction. Reinforces insider understanding before the final CTA.
