## The Challenge Section

**Headline:**
A lighting distributor wanted strategic growth in an uncertain market

Breakthrough Lighting is a commercial lighting distribution and procurement specialist serving electrical contractors, designers, and architects across California.

They were already running outreach through PersistIQ (previous vendor, $1,500/month) and generating about 5 solid relationships per month at $300 per relationship. But they wanted more:

- **25-30% increase** in new relationships beyond organic baseline
- **20% more project opportunities** to bid on
- **Access to larger design-build firms** and bigger general contractors
- **Strategic partnership**, not just vendor relationship
- **Growth despite 2025 market uncertainty** (tariffs, projects on hold, market volatility)

They needed a partner who would invest in their success—not just execute campaigns.

## The Approach Section

**Headline:**
Strategic partnership focused on quality over volume

Unlike their previous vendor relationship, Breakthrough Lighting positioned our engagement as a strategic partnership from day one.

### Multi-channel project intelligence

- **ConstructConnect targeting:** Active electrical projects with identified lighting scope
- **Dodge targeting:** Project-based outreach to electrical contractors and GCs
- **Persona-based campaigns:** Interior designers and architects who specify lighting

### Quality-focused outreach

We reduced email volume from 1,500/month (PersistIQ) to ~1,000/month—but achieved higher conversion rates through better targeting and personalization.

- Researched, personalized messaging (not generic templates)
- Multi-touch sequences (prospects didn't respond until 3rd attempt in many cases)
- Relationship-focused approach, not transactional sales pitches

### Integration with internal BD team

We didn't replace Breakthrough's internal business development efforts—we complemented them. Our systematic outreach fed opportunities to their BD managers, who handled discovery calls and relationship deepening.

### Complete rebrand

Beyond outreach, we delivered a complete brand refresh that positioned Breakthrough as a strategic partner rather than a commodity vendor—changing how they present themselves to electrical contractors, designers, and architects.

## The Market Context Section

**Headline:**
Growth achieved despite 2025's unprecedented challenges

Joe Pineda's assessment of the 2025 market:

*"2025, we've had the rollercoaster of tariffs and uncertainty and jobs being put on hold... This is not the greatest year to compare year-over-year improvements because of turmoil. The fact that we had such a nice bump anyway speaks volumes of the work that you guys did, the groundwork that we've laid for ourselves."*

**Despite facing:**
- Tariff uncertainty halting purchasing decisions
- Projects on hold waiting for market clarity
- Interest rate volatility
- Supply chain concerns
- Overall market nervousness

**Breakthrough Lighting still achieved $2MM growth.**

Why? Because systematic outreach doesn't stop when markets freeze. When competitors pull back on business development spending, that's exactly when you should maintain presence. When the market eventually stabilizes, you're already top-of-mind with decision-makers.

## The Strategic Partnership Difference Section

**Headline:**
Why positioning this as partnership mattered

From Joe Pineda:

*"I wanted this to be a partnership, right, more than just you guys providing a service. I wanted you guys to participate in our success... We still think of you guys as a strategic partner more than anything else."*

### The "three-legged stool" framework

Joe positions systematic BD as one of three critical growth drivers:
1. **CRM/HubSpot:** Organizing and tracking all relationships
2. **NetSuite:** Operational efficiency and financial management
3. **Systematic BD (Sunrise):** Consistent relationship generation and outreach

This integration mindset created strategic partnership, not vendor relationship.

### Attribution and honesty

Joe's honest assessment of attribution:

*"The one thing where it's a challenge is that because I had hired business development managers prior to bringing you guys on board, and they were already actively pursuing a lot of these same type of customers, it's hard for me to say at this point which ones came as a result of the outreach and which ones came as a result of the internal outreach."*

**His conclusion:** *"I would venture to say that it was probably a third was because of them, and maybe two-thirds was because of you guys, because you guys sort of came in, cleaned it up, and you were more effective reaching out to some of these people."*

That means: **$10M of $15.67M attributed to systematic BD = 64% of total pipeline.**

## Proof Of Persistence Section

**Headline:**
The power of systematic follow-up

Recent success story from Joe demonstrates the process:

An interior designer didn't respond until the **3rd outreach attempt**. When she finally responded, that led to a **Zoom call** (set up by our team). The Zoom call led to **project with drawings and renderings sent**. Now in active pipeline.

*"That was all you guys, you know, making the contact, because I believe she didn't answer until the third attempt. She finally said, okay, you know, what do you guys have? And then that turned into the Zoom, and then the Zoom turned into the opportunity."* —Joe

**The lesson:** Systematic persistence + professional follow-up = opportunities that would have been lost with one-and-done outreach.

## What Made This Work Section

**Headline:**
Why this partnership delivered exceptional ROI

### Quality over quantity
Fewer emails, better targeting, higher conversion. We prioritized the right prospects over blast volume.

### Multi-channel coordination
Combining ConstructConnect project intelligence, Dodge targeting, and persona-based campaigns created multiple paths to opportunities.

### Persistent follow-up
Many prospects didn't engage until the 3rd touchpoint. Systematic persistence captured opportunities others would have missed.

### Strategic integration
We complemented Breakthrough's internal BD team rather than competing with them. Our outreach fed their relationship development process.

### Brand positioning
The complete rebrand helped Breakthrough present as a strategic partner, not a commodity vendor—changing how prospects perceived and engaged with them.

### Partnership mindset
Joe viewed us as part of his growth infrastructure (the "three-legged stool"), not a replaceable vendor. That mindset drove better collaboration and results.
