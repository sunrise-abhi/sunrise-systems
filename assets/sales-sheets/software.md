# **Custom Technology Built For Construction Operations**

Your business has unique operational challenges that off-the-shelf software can't solve. 

**We build custom technology that brings your vision to life**—whether that's replacing bloated systems like Procore, modernizing decades-old databases, or creating centralized dashboards that show exactly what you need to see (and nothing you don't).

## Central Operations System

**One Dashboard, Tailored To Your Entire Operation**

Every Sunrise client gets our proprietary Central Operations system—but we customize it to fit your specific needs. Whether you need visibility into our marketing efforts or want to replace your entire tech stack with a custom portal, we build it around how you actually operate.

* Real-time operational visibility into marketing campaigns, outreach activity, and project status  
* Role-based customization so employees, partners, and clients see exactly what they need (nothing more)  
* Unified pipeline management that combines your estimating and project tracking in one place

# Legacy System Upgrade

**Unlock Decades of Valuable Project History**

That old database from the 90s? The contact list buried in dead email accounts? We extract it and modernize it. 

* Database recovery from outdated systems (1990s-2000s software, inaccessible formats)  
* Dormant contact reactivation by mining old inboxes and re-engaging past relationships  
* Cloud migration that turns legacy data into modern, searchable records

Case Study: We extracted a client's 1994-2007 project database, migrated it to the cloud, and recovered thousands of valuable contacts from past projects.

## AI & Automation Tools

**Technology Built To Handle Your Busy Work**

We build in-house artificial intelligence tools and automated systems that handle repetitive work, so your team focuses on relationships and revenue.

* Automated re-engagement campaigns that revive dormant client relationships  
* Custom scripts for email mining, contact curation, and account-based outreach  
* Intelligent workflows that trigger follow-ups based on project milestones or client behavior

Our internal proprietary tech makes our processes efficient and we give you that same system.

“Sunrise really gets the feeling of who we are and what we're doing. They're really going to have a long-term impact with getting us those bigger, more profitable commercial projects, and that's why I went with them over other short-term options.

They're doing a great thing and I'm happy to be working with them because I know it's money well spent… and in reality they should be charging a lot more.”

## **OLD DRAFT**

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Contractors today manage millions in projects across tools that were never built for their workflow. Information gets buried, updates fall behind, and opportunities are missed because there’s no clear view of what’s happening. 

Our software team was built to change that. 

We give every client full visibility into marketing, outreach, and operational activity, along with tailored solutions to untangle complex tech challenges. From extracting valuable data trapped in outdated systems to developing modern portals that connect teams and clients, our goal is to help builders run their business with clarity and control.

#### **BRINGING VISIBILITY AND EFFICIENCY TO YOUR GROWTH ENGINE**

### **The Problem**

* Too many contractors still run multi-million-dollar operations on pen and paper.

* Projects and leads get scattered across notes, spreadsheets, and inboxes.

* When you don’t have visibility, you can’t improve, and growth stalls before it starts.
