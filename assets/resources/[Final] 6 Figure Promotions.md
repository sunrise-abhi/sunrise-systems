**Introduction** 

**Rundown** 

Welcome\! :-) 

Take a shot or two. And celebrate. 

Because this “course” is going to give you the marketing education of a lifetime. And make you a shit ton of $$$’s (diarrhea levels—if you apply it). 

How can I be so sure?

Because this course isn’t thrown together to make a quick buck. 

Nah. 

It’s a course soaked in value. 

And is very different than everything you’ve probably tried and used before (nothing is held back). 

In fact, I’ve made this course specifically to give to new employees so I can “quickly” train them and get them caught up to speed on how we do things around here (I’ve been running a digital ad agency for the last 4 years). 

In other words, it’s not a loosely thrown together course. 

Everything is connected. And each part builds on the part before because it’s my personal 3-part process (one that I learned directly by watching an 8-figure marketer work his magic). 

I’ve borrowed it. Learned it. Implemented it. 

And for the past 4 years I’ve been using it to invent high converting marketing promotions (that pull in 6 to 7 figures) for clients (and myself) on autopilot. 

And the best part? 

It works for anything you have to sell. 

In fact, I’ve used this 3-part process to craft promotions for: 

* Supplements   
* Info products  
* SAAS companies   
* Personal brands  
* Consultants  
* Coaches  
* Dropshipping stores  
* eCom companies   
* Affiliates  
* Digital agencies 

(You can use this process to write sales letters, ads, emails, VSL’s, etc.)

If I put together a sales page to sell this product (which I probably will down the line), I’ll be using the exact 3-part process I’m teaching you in this course to do it. 

And you’ll see the exact steps applied in real time. 

Because if I ever had a “secret” (I don’t) to making BIG bucks FAST via copywriting and marketing, this would be it. 

So let’s cut straight to the heart of the matter… 

And introduce you to the 3-part process you’ll be learning in this course: 

**Part 1 \- Moving Inside Your Target’s Head**   
**Part 2 \- Turning Dirt Into Gold**  
**Part 3 \- Giving Birth To A Larger Than Life Marketing Message** 

If you want to make serious moula, then you should NEVER write a word of copy for anything (ads, email, sales letters, VSL’s) until you’ve subjected your copy through this 3-part process (I don’t even start a “new” business until I’ve run my idea through this process). 

I mean it. 

Otherwise, you’ll get crummy results. 

Or leave massive dough on the table. 

If you don’t want to do that (who does), then get ready. 

Because once you learn this, you’ll be able to invent killer promotions on auto-pilot from scratch (and write them with ease—no need to read any copywriting or marketing books either). 

Why?

Because this 3-part process **teaches you how to think**. 

*Market*. 

And play the game. 

In short, it gives you what no other course can:

*The juice (or the “sauce” \- whatever lol).* 

Ready to drink it?

Not so fast… 

Before I hand you the glass and fix you a drink, I’m going to give you a quick rundown of what to expect and how you should consume this course (don’t ignore this—it’ll ensure you get the most bang for your buck\!). 

**What To Expect** 

No bullshit. *No fluff.* 

I hate courses full with 38 hours of video. 920 minutes of audio. 9302 pages of text. 

Because all they’re doing is fluffing their course so they can raise the “perceived” value.

And charge you a higher price for it. 

It’s bullshit. 

Because no one actually has time to go through all that information. 

So even though you’re determined, you stop half way through.

And don’t get much out of it. 

Sad, right? 

Yep.

Most online courses aren’t designed to help you succeed (they’re designed to make the creator $). 

If they were, they wouldn’t fluff the hell out of their course. 

So when it comes to this course, you can rest assured knowing that I’m not fluffing you up with fluff. *At all.* 

I’m just revealing the 3-step process. 

And guiding you step-by-step.

And showing you how to apply it. 

And giving you a **behind the scenes** look at how I’ve applied it to create and launch 6 and 7 figure promotions (both for myself and clients)—because “proof” matters in this day and age (as it should). 

So you can quickly and easily take what you learn and apply it to get results.

That’s all I care about. 

*Results.* 

And you should too. 

So click the button above to mark this section complete. 

And I’ll give you the quick brief on how you should consume this course so you can maximize your Return On Investment (ROI) before we jump into the fun stuff. 

**How To Consume This Course** 

This isn’t a passive course. 

It’s not a course you sit back and consume. 

No. 

It’s a process. 

One you must follow if you desire BIG results. 

It doesn’t matter if you’re a seasoned pro making chunks of change… 

Or young and full of bravado, and you don’t have 2 nickels to rub together… 

**I’ll be giving you the step-by-step process for turning BIG IDEAS into gold.** 

Just follow and apply. 

And we’ll turn NOTHING into a high converting marketing promotion—*one that pulls in the benjamins*. 

But before we do, there’s one important thing you must know:

**Most people sell you the juice without ever showing you their juice.** 

That’s that shit I don’t like (Chief Keef Voice).

I’m not going to do that. 

When I say I use this 3-part process to craft 6-7 figure promotions, I mean it. 

And to prove it to you… 

I’m not just going to reveal every step of the process. 

And show you **two** 6 figure promotions I wrote. 

BUT I’m also going to follow this process inside this course (step-by-step).

And invent a promotion from scratch (so you can see exactly how I apply the process). 

This will give you the most value because it’s easy to read and nod along, but until you see the application—you won’t fully get it. 

So at the end of each step will be a **“See It In Action”** section and it is here where I’ll build a 6 figure promotion from scratch. 

**What Do You Need (And What Are We Going To Do Here)**

We’re going to invent a marketing promotion from scratch (that has the potential to pull in 6-7 figures). 

**What exactly is a “marketing promotion”?** 

A marketing promotion is a sales message (sales letter, VSL, product page etc.) used to sell a product or service. 

You simply create it once. 

Put it in front of the *right* target. 

And sit back and pull in the BIG money. 

In fact, Agora (the billion dollar direct-response publishing empire) has been doing just this for decades. And making a killing. 

In this course, we’re going to follow the “Agora” model. And the type of marketing promotion we’re building is a long-form sales letter. 

Here are examples of long-form sales letters:

[$2 Billion Wall St. Journal Letter](http://swiped.co/file/wallstreet-letter-conroy/?_sf_s=wall+street)  

[Dollar Letter Promo by Gary Halbert](http://swiped.co/file/famous-dollar-letter-by-gary-halbert/?_sf_s=gary+halbert) 

[Consulting Sales Letter by Frank Kern](http://swiped.co/file/consulting-sales-letter-from-frank-kern/?_sf_s=frank+kern) 

**Why are we building a long-form sales letter?** 

Because it’s the holy grail. 

I don’t care if you’re doing dropshipping, affiliate marketing, running a social media agency or none of the above. Doesn’t freakin’ matter. One bit. 

If you can \*build\* a killer long-form sales letter and generate six figures or more from it (with cold traffic), you’re set for life (and I’ll show you how you can apply it to whichever business model you’re in). 

Not to mention if you know how to write a killer long-form sales letter, then writing copy for everything else becomes a complete breeze: 

* Facebook Ads  
* Video Sales Letters (VSL)  
* Product descriptions   
* Landing pages  
* Autoresponders  
* Upsell pages  
* Downsell pages   
* Etc. 

**Note:** There’s a reason the legends of Direct Response recommend you write a long-form sales letter BEFORE you write any other type of copy (including short ads). And it’s because it sets the foundation. The blueprint. So many rookies jump into the marketing world and go straight to writing product descriptions for their e-commerce store or whatnot. And they fail. *Badly.*

Got it? 

I hope you’re nodding your head up and down like a bobble-head because you’re about to learn the game. 

The game only known to the world’s greatest direct response marketers (if you don’t believe me you can go back and study every successful direct response marketer in history and you’ll see they were using this exact process to make BIG $$$s). 

Up till now… 

Nobody \*shared\* this process. 

But that changes *today*. 

So if you’re a newbie pay extra careful attention because you’ll not only be introduced to the *right way* to market and sell online (but you’ll develop a solid foundation, cut YEARS off your learning curve, and make BIG $’s a lot faster). 

And if you’re a seasoned marketer? 

You’ll be able to use this process to KILL IT (in a matter of weeks/months). 

**So what exactly do you need?**

Not much—to be honest. 

When I say we’re inventing 6-7 figure promotions from scratch, *I mean that*. 

So we’re going to start from zero and build ourselves a killer promotion.

Step-by-step. 

But if you already have a product or service, that’s good. 

You can simply use this process to craft a killer marketing promotion for your offer. 

If you don’t have a product or service, that’s great. One of the things we’re going to do here is create an irresistible offer with this 3-part process (because as you’re about to see—I don’t believe in doing things the \*conventional\* way). 

Cool?

Time to get crackin’. 

But before we do… 

I’m going to quickly answer your most pressing questions. 

**Questions**

At this time you probably have a few questions running through your dome piece. 

So let me take a moment to answer em: 

**(1) Does this 3-part marketing process work for any product?** 

Yes. No bullshit either.  

(You’ll be able to prove this to yourself.) 

**(2) Does this work for any business model?**

Marketing is marketing. 

The process applies to everything you do. 

Fact.

However, I’ve only applied this process to the following business models myself (excluding what I’ve done for clients):

* Marketing agency  
* E-commerce  
* Info products  
* Personal branding 

And it works. *Like gold.* 

But will it work for drop shipping, affiliate marketing, niche websites? 

I’m not sure about niche websites (never used it or helped anyone use it). 

But it’ll definitely work for drop shipping. And affiliate marketing.

I have a few clients in dropshipping/affiliate marketing who are using this process to make out like bandits. 

**Note:** In the conclusion section I’ll show you how you can apply this process for whatever business model you’re pursuing. 

**(3) Should you just consume this course once?**

No. 

Consume (skim) this course every time you have to create a marketing promotion. 

At least, in the early days. 

(If you’re lazy—simply use the cheat sheet at the end of the course to guide you.) 

So you can *burn this process* into your mind. 

Once you do, you don’t need to consume this course as frequently. 

Return to it every now and then. 

(Maybe once or twice a year.) 

And you’ll have all you need to strike it BIG. 

So now that we got all the housekeeping stuff out of our way, let’s get on with the heart of the course. 

We begin with Part 1\. 

Something you have to do every single time you want to “invent” a 6-7 figure marketing promotion from scratch: 

**Getting inside your target’s head.** 

**Part 1 \- Getting Inside Your Target’s Head** 

**Rundown** 

*“Become a student of markets. Not products. Not techniques. Not copywriting. Not how to buy space or whatever. Now of course, all of these things are important and you must learn about them, but, the first and the most important thing you must learn is what people want to buy. Observe what they do buy. Not what people say they buy. Be a student of reality. The only advantage you want is a starving crowd. Constantly be on the lookout for groups of people (markets) who have demonstrated that they are starving (or at least hungry\!) for some particular product or service.”* 

\- Gary C. Halbert  

![][image1]  
            Print this out and staple it to your wall. 

Every 6-7 figure marketing promotion starts here. 

*Every marketing promotion that fails either skips this step (or doesn’t collect enough \*intelligence\*).*

No bullshit. 

The more work you do here, the more money you’ll make. 

Excited?

Good. 

Because here’s the thing: 

This part is *boring.* 

I hate it. 

It’s grueling. Tiring. *Frustrating.* 

**But it’s what separates killer marketing from dud marketing.** 

If you’re in this game, you don’t want to create dud marketing. 

95% of the market creates dud marketing.

And dud marketing makes dud dollars. 

$0. 

**Create killer marketing if you want to make a killing.** 

*But how, Tej?\!*

I’ll show you. 

Now even though I prefaced this section by making *Part 1* sound hard and grueling, it’s really not. 

(Copywriting Tip: Always position your shit as “easy” and “quick”—the brain runs away from “hard” and procrastinates. This is why 5 minute weight loss cures always sell. But 2 years of proper exercise and nutrition will never inspire the masses to buy.)

And that’s because you ONLY have to answer 3 questions. 

Yep just 3\. 

Once you answer these questions, 50% of the work is done. 

Seriously. No BS. 

Most people never create high converting marketing because they jump right into the “writing” part (without giving 2 shits about these questions). 

Or worse, they pick a product or service to sell BEFORE they’ve asked these questions.

(If you do this, there’s a high likelihood nobody will buy what you’re selling.)

Because here’s the thing:

Great marketing (that pulls in 6 and 7 figures) is written BEFORE you even write a single word (or determine what to sell). 

“Wait… what?\!”

Yep, reread that again. 

Most people consider the “writing” and “product selection” part of marketing the hard part. *It’s not.* 

That’s the easy part . 

**The “hard” part is EVERYTHING you do BEFORE you write a single word.** 

And everything you do before involves answering just 3 *simple* questions:

**1\. Who is starving?**  
**2\. Where does your market live?**  
**3\. How much does your target know?**

In *Part 1*, we’ll be diving into each of these 3 questions in detail. And I’ll walk you step-by-step through the application process. 

**1\. Who Is Starving?** 

Most people approach marketing all wrong (in my opinion). 

They create a product or service. Then market it.

And fail. Or make *baby money*.  

I don’t do this. You shouldn’t either. 

Why? 

Because if you start with a product or service, it won’t be irresistible. It won’t stand out. It won’t position you like a G. It won’t make you the BIG bucks. It won’t have an *increased* possibility of success. 

No. 

*“So if you don’t start with a product or service—then where do you start, Tej?”*

I start with a starving market of people. 

And find a submarket inside the starving market. 

And find a niche market inside the submarket. 

And find a specific target inside the niche market. 

And then you know what I do? 

I figure out what type of \*food\* (product/service) would get this person’s mouth watering. 

(Hint: It won’t be the type of food he’s already used to eating. Nope. It has to be unique.) 

Then I \*INVENT\* this \*NEW\* type of food. 

And because I’m the only one selling this type of \*FOOD\* … and it solves my target’s problem (better than anything else), he or she has no choice but to give me his money in exchange for my food. 

Confused?

No worries. 

That’s the BIG picture. 

And I wanted you to see it (because it’s what you’ll be learning to do inside this course step-by-step). 

But for now… 

Let’s not skip steps. 

Let’s go back to asking ourselves who is starving. 

Because dope marketing starts with a starving market. 

**So what exactly is a starving market?**

*Starving Market* \= A market of people with a \*pressing need or problem\* that are already paying BIG $$$’s to avoid pain or gain pleasure.  

**Why is a starving market important?**

You cannot \*INVENT\* 6 and 7 figure promotions if you don’t target a **specific** target inside a **starving market**.

Simple—right?

Wrong. 

When it comes to marketing people think the more people they appeal to, the more money they’ll make. 

Mistake.

The opposite is true. 

**The hungrier your market and the more specific your target, the better your marketing will resonate. And the more money you’ll make.** 

Period. 

So the first question we have to ask is this:

**Who is starving?** 

This is the person you want to sell to. 

When determining this: 

It’s important you choose a VERY specific target (inside a starving market) with a VERY specific problem (I’ll tell you how in just a moment). 

There may be a bunch of targets you want to sell to (expecting moms, new moms, moms of 1-2 year olds) and that’s fine. 

But make a list. And rank the list from best to worse. 

Then take the best.

And make the target very specific. 

This is the person you’re going to be shooting the arrow at. 

And once it hits her square in the eye, she’ll have no choice but to take out her wallet and give you $. 

**Examples of bad targets:** 

* Dumb accountants   
* Women looking to lose weight   
* Men wanting to get ripped

**Examples of good targets:**

* Entry-level accountant at Deloitte wanting to become more efficient and productive so she can outcompete peers and make partner.    
* 35 year old mother of 2 who wants to lose the 15 pounds she put on during pregnancy   
* 24 year old skinny-fat man wanting an extra 10 pounds of muscle 

Get the idea?

Cool. 

Now it’s your turn to find a specific target inside a starving market. 

**(Step-By-Step Guide) How To Find A Specific Target (Inside A Starving Market)**

**Step (1) Start with a starving market**

“A market is the overall set of buyers and sellers for a broad market need, such as the banking market, or the education market, or the ready-to-eat food market.” \- Segmentation Study Guide

Here are examples of starving markets: 

* Health and fitness   
* Dating and relationships  
* Wealth (Make Money Online)  
* Spirituality 

Want more?

1\. Go to [www.ClickBank.com](http://www.clickbank.com)    
2\. Click on ‘Affiliate Marketplace’   
3\. On the left hand side you’ll see a list of categories 

![][image2]

![][image3]  
These categories are starving markets. 

Some markets are more hungry than others. 

But this is a very good starting point. 

**Step (2) Find sub-markets within starving markets** 

“A sub-market forms part of an overall market, but tends to have some unique operating characteristics. For example, the banking market could be split into the sub-markets of credit cards, home loans, online savings, and so on.” \- Segmentation Study Guide

Once you’ve found a starving market—it’s time to find a submarket within your starving market. 

Why? 

Markets are huge. 

Full of different groups of people with unique needs, wants, and desires. 

To find your submarket you have to break down the starving market into its individual parts. 

For example: 

If “dating” was your starving market, then these could be a few of the submarkets inside this starving market (there’s many ways to break down a market into submarkets—I personally like breaking markets down by people):

* Dating help for men  
* Dating help for women  
* Dating help for divorcees   
* Etc. 

Choose a submarket.

**Step (3) Find a niche market within the submarket** 

Now take your submarket and break it down into niches. 

Going off our dating example. 

Let’s assume we chose dating help for men (as our submarket). 

Here’s a few niches (inside this submarket): 

* Finding a girlfriend  
* First dates  
* Phone game  
* Approaching  
* Performance in bed  
* Etc. 

Pick a niche (could be any niche you’re interested in—we don’t care so much about the niche, we just want to find a specific target inside a niche).

**Step (4) Find a target within your niche market**

Take your niche and enter it into Google alongside the word “forum”.

Click a few links. 

Read. 

See what types of people are inside this niche. 

What problem do they have?

What do they want to achieve? 

For example:

Maybe you pick ‘performance in bed’ as your niche market (you dirty little boy). 

And you do some digging. 

And find out the people in this niche are “25 year old virgins who are living at home with terrible social anxiety and have never had a girlfriend.” 

This would be your target. 

Aka

Your “Customer Avatar”.

**Step 4: Stalk your target like your crazy ex stalked you**

Now you have to get inside your chosen target’s head (because he or she represents the market at large). 

And dissect your target inside out. 

I personally use forums, FB groups, YouTube videos, books, and in person interviews to stalk my target. 

(Google is your best friend.)

Doesn’t matter what you use. 

**But here are the questions you need to answer about your target** (I stole this from Digital Marketer):

*Age:*

*Gender:*

*Marital Status:*

*\#/Age of Children:*

*Location:*

*Favorite Quote:* 

*Occupation:*

*Job Title:*

*Annual Income:*

*Level of Education:*

*Goals:* 

1\.  
2\.  
3\.

*Values:*

1\.  
2\.  
3\.

*Problems:*

1\.  
2\.  
3\.

*What keeps him/her up at night?*

1\.  
2\.  
3\.

*Where Does He/She Get His Information:*

Books \- 

Magazines \-

Blogs/Websites \- 

Conferences \- 

Gurus \-

Other \- 

*Thoughts & Beliefs* 

Common objections/limiting thoughts \- 

1\.  
2\.  
3\.

*What does an average day look like for the target?* 

\[insert small paragraph\]

**Pro Tip:** Once you’ve filled out the above, I would go on to Google and pick out an image of someone who resembles your target. This may seem like an unnecessary step but it makes shit real. 

Most people fail online with their marketing because they forget PEOPLE consume messages.

Sure you may never see these people. 

And you have a tendency to think in terms of numbers and traffic. 

But those numbers are real live people. 

So find an avatar for your audience. A picture of your market. 

Just Google your target. 

Pick someone out. 

Give the person a name. *A brief background story.*

Make him or her real. 

And you’re on your way. 

This is phase A (very easy step—we’re just beginning). 

Once you’re done with this phase, it’s time for the next one:

To determine where your market stands. 

But before we get into that, I’m going to apply what we just went over to the marketing promotion I’m building inside this course (step-by-step). 

**Progress Check: At this point you should have picked a very specific target. This could be a target for a product you’re already selling. Or a completely new target you want to eventually sell to (doesn’t matter).** 

**See It In Action:** 

In this step I’ll be choosing a target for the marketing promotion I’m building inside this course. 

And you know what I’m going to do? 

I’m going to choose a target from one of the BIG 3 markets. 

The markets people think you can’t make “BIG MONEY” in anymore because they’re too saturated. *Bullshit.* 

You can’t make BIG MONEY because you don’t know how to market. 

Lucky for you I’m about to show you how to market and make a killing in any market—including the BIG 3\. 

What are the BIG 3 markets (recap)?

1\. Love  
2\. Wealth  
3\. Heath 

I’m going to create a marketing promotion for the ‘Love’ market. 

So let’s pick a target. 

Now there’s a lot to choose from. 

So many potential targets. 

*Too many.* 

So I’m going to get specific, very specific. And choose a target with a serious problem in a particular niche.

*Niche I’m choosing is:* 

**Spiritual Love niche.**  

*Target I’m choosing:* 

**A 40-year old spiritual, religious, superstitious Christian female who has been cheated on in the past and is now *alone* and struggling to find love.** 

Why am I choosing this target? 

Few reasons: 

* It’s a specific type of target (not just any female but a spiritual/superstitious/religious/Christian female 40 and above)  
    
* Urgency is built into the target already (she’s 40+ and alone and struggling—most women want to be married in their 30’s so this target may feel like she’s running out of time and is desperate for a solution (which we’re going to help deliver). 

Now my job isn’t done yet. 

Just like I told you to do, I also have to dig deeper into this target and determine what is running through her head. 

**Here are some of the thoughts running through my target’s head (based on my research):** 

* When will I meet my soulmate/love of my life? What sign will there be?  
* Am I ever going to get married?   
* I hate watching my friends find the love of their life while I sit here alone and feel unwanted.   
* Why have all my romantic relationships failed?  
* Why do men always cheat on me?   
* What’s wrong with me?   
* Why can’t I attract and keep the right type of man? 

Great. 

Now I’m going to hop on Google and find an image of someone who resembles my target and I’m going to give her a name.

Here’s the picture I chose and the name I’m giving my target is Susan: 

**![][image4]**

Notice how I chose a picture that not only resembles my target, but also the emotions she is feeling. 

This is important (it’s a visual way for me to be reminded of my targets problem—good thing to keep near when I’m writing copy). 

Okay that’s all the action I have to take in this stage. 

Onto question number 2\. 

**2\. Where Does Your Market Live?** 

It’s not enough to pick a target to shoot at. 

If you want to hit em (and make a killing), you must know where they live.

95% of marketers don’t think about this. 

Is it any wonder why they fall flat on their face? 

Not to me. 

And once you’re done this course, it won’t be surprising to you either. 

Because the one thing I want to burn into your brain is this: 

Do the upfront work in Part 1 and marketing is easy. 

This entire 3-part process is proven and tested.

And you know what?

It’s simple. Nothing complicated. 

All you need is:

* Discipline  
* A sprinkle of creativity 

That’s it. 

*“But what about copywriting skills, Tej?\!”*

Yeah you need copy skills. But they’re not as important. 

Because Part 3 does all the work for you. 

More on that later.

For now we need you to exercise discipline. 

And answer the second question:

**Where does your market live?** 

This question is important because each market is different. 

Some markets are *extremely developed*. 

Others markets are *new and emerging*. 

Every market has context (and you would “market” your products and services based on THIS context—if you want to stack maximum cash in minimum time).

**So it’s your job to find out this context.** 

And see where your market lives.

Don’t worry.

It’s very easy to do.  

In fact, there’s only 5 places where your market can live. 

These 5 places are called **stages of market sophistication** (I know this sounds fancy and scary, but it’s stupid simple)**.** And they were popularized by Eugene Schwartz (a true legend).

Here are the 5 stages (when reading through these stages \*THINK\* about where your starving market lives):  

**(1) First Stage of Market Sophistication**

A blue ocean. A new market. *Brand new.* 

So new in fact… 

You’re the first seller in this market. 

And there is zero competition. 

And the targets inside this market have never heard any sales pitches or read any sales letters about products and services in this market before. 

Most starving markets do not live here. 

At all. 

Why?

The first stage of market sophistication usually comes when a new market is created by some sort of innovation. 

For example, when Viagra was first created it was used to treat blood pressure. But somebody discovered it also worked for Erectile Dysfunction. The creators of Viagra realized that would be more profitable. And they \*created\* the ED pills market.

At this time, nobody else was selling pills that gave you a boner lol. 

So the market was brand new. 

It was in the first stage of market sophistication. 

**(2) Second Stage of Market Sophistication**

No longer is the market brand new. 

No longer is there only one player in the market. 

Times have changed. 

Competition has caught up. And they have started to introduce competing products to the market. 

Some online markets live here. 

But most don’t.

(This market is still relatively new.)

**(3) Third Stage of Market Sophistication**

Once the market reaches the third stage of market sophistication, the targets inside the market start getting bombarded with sales pitches, offers, products, services. 

*The whole nine.* 

Because competition is wild. 

And you know what?

This is where most online markets live. 

You know the BIG 3? 

1\) Wealth  
2\) Dating  
3\) Weight Loss 

For the most part, those markets reside in this stage of sophistication. 

And that’s because: 

There’s SO much competition. 

And targets are being hit with new offers every day. 

“LOSE WEIGHT\!”

“DO THIS TO DROP 25 POUNDS\!”

“EAT THIS TO GET THIN”

It’s very noisy. *Full of complete chaos*. 

**(4) Fourth Stage of Market Sophistication** 

At this point the market is pushed to the extreme. 

And two major competitors emerge (and they eat up most of the market share). 

Apple vs. Samsung. 

Google vs. Facebook. 

Coke vs. Pepsi. 

Most online markets aren’t here yet.

So I wouldn’t worry too much about this stage. 

**(5) Fifth Stage of Market Sophistication** 

The targets inside the market are tired. 

They no longer believe advertising. 

They no longer give a shit. 

They have lost hope. 

But here’s the thing: 

*Their desire is still alive. And well.* 

They still want to solve their problems. 

They just don’t know if any product or service on the market will actually help them (because they’ve pretty much tried everything and were only left with disappointment running through their veins).

Now that you know the 5 stages of market sophistication, let’s take a deep dive and determine where YOUR starving market lives (the one you determined in phase A). 

**(Step-By-Step Guide) How To Determine Market Sophistication:** 

**Step (1) Enter your market into Google, Amazon, Facebook search. And see how many people are selling products to your starving market/niche. And see how many Facebook groups exist for it.** 

The higher the number, the more sophisticated your market is. 

**Step (2) Measure the general temperature of the targets inside your starving market.**

Type in your market \+ forum (or check Reddit) and see what your targets are talking about. 

Are they excited? Determined? Passionate?

Or fed up and sick and tired of all the products in the space? 

If they’re excited, your market is still in the first few levels of sophistication (Bitcoin/Crypto). 

If they’re engaged and doing a lot of comparisons, they’re probably in Level 3 (for the most part). 

And with the rare exception they’ll be beyond Level 3 (but most markets are not here). 

*Important: There is no need to go full psycho mode when determining this. We’re just looking for general intelligence. That’s it. So don’t beat yourself over this. The goal is just to do quick research and get familiar with your market. And build your empathy muscle (so you know who they are, where they stand and how much they know—which we’ll discuss in the next section). Once you know this, you’ll be able to \*INVENT\* a killer product or service to sell, market it like a champ and get filthy rich while helping your target reach their goals.*

**Progress Check: At this point you should have a target and know where your market lives (what level).** 

**See It In Action:** 

Remember Susan? **The 40-year old spiritual, religious, superstitious Christian female who has been cheated on in the past and is now *alone* and struggling to find love.** 

Aka our target?

Well it’s time to determine where her market lives. 

Again the starving market I picked is the love market. 

And the niche is the spiritual/love market. 

And after doing my research, the stage of Market Sophistication is Level 3\. 

Why?

The spiritual love market belongs to one of the BIG 3 markets (LOVE & RELATIONSHIPS) and this market has been running wild online for decades.

And the targets inside this market (people like Susan) have heard all the claims. 

And have been hit with offer after offer. 

Just take a look at how many Google results showed up for products and services in this market:  
![][image5]  
This would scare most people. 

But it doesn’t scare me. 

And it won’t scare you at the end of this course either. 

Because honestly? 

It doesn’t matter. 

(We’re going to outmarket everyone with our killer 3-step process.)

Onto the next (and final) question—*in Part 1\.* 

**Note:** If you’re a beginner there’s no need for you to enter markets with lots of competition. You can if you want. You’ll be able to make $ with this 3 step process. But I’m just using this LOVE market with TONS of competition as an example to show you the powers of this process (because I help clients who do compete in these BIG markets make BIG dollars following this 3-step process). 

**3\. How Much Does Your Target Know?** 

Alright. Alright. Alright. (Kevin Hart Voice). 

Now that we know our target (aka who we’re shooting the arrow at) and where the market lives—it’s time for the last question (in part 1): 

**How much does our target know?**

Why is this question important to ask?

A few reasons. 

People respond to different marketing messages depending on how much they know. 

If someone already knows Apple and exactly what the new iPhone does and they want it, you would market to him differently than you would to someone living in an igloo who has no clue what Apple is. 

Agree? 

Of course. 

But when it comes to marketing most people don’t do this. *At all.*  

Instead they throw random shit against the marketing wall and hope and pray it works. 

It doesn’t. 

The marketing I’m teaching you is calculated. Once you follow the steps, you’ll know for a fact the arrow is going to hit the bullseye or fall close to it (BEFORE you even launch your campaign). 

So let’s get on with the last question (and then we’ll get to the \*JUICY\* fun part). 

Luckily, the answer to this question is also very easy to find. 

Because just like the stages of market sophistication, there are only five levels where your target’s awareness level can reside. 

These are called the Five Levels of Target Awareness. 

**What are levels of awareness?** *A rough idea of how much your target knows about his or her problem and the solutions available in the marketplace.* 

Once you figure this out, you’ll be able to craft the right offer and the right marketing to spark your targets interest (which we’ll build together in Part 2 and Part 3).

**Here are the 5 levels of awareness** popularized by Eugene Schwartz that every \*SMART\* marketer rips off (when reading through these stages all you have to do is \*THINK\* about where your target’s level of awareness is at): 

(Note: I’ve included Eugene Schwartz’ comments below alongside my own.) 

**Level 1 \- Clueless Target** 

*“The prospect is either not aware of his desire or his need—or he won’t honestly admit it to himself without being led into it by your ad—or the need is so general and amorphous that it resists being summed up in a single headline—or it’s a secret that just can’t be verbalized.”* 

These targets don’t know they have a problem. 

They don’t know a solution exists. 

And they most definitely don’t know about you and what you have to offer. 

**Level 2 \- Problem Aware Target**

*“The prospect has—not a desire—but a need. He recognizes the need immediately. But he doesn’t yet realize the connection between the fulfillment of that need and your product.”* 

These targets are aware of their problem.

It’s there. 

They can feel it. 

They can even start to understand it.

But they don’t yet see the connection between their \*problem\* and the \*solutions\* available on the marketplace.  

**Level 3 \- Solution Aware Target**

*“The prospect either knows, or recognizes immediately, that he wants what the product does; but he doesn’t yet know that there is a product—your product—that will do it for him.”*

These targets know they have a problem. And a solution exists. 

But they haven’t yet found it. 

**Level 4 \- Target Knows of the Product But Doesn’t Yet Want It** 

*“Here, your prospect isn’t completely aware of all your product does, or isn’t convinced of how well it does it, or hasn’t yet been told how much better it does it now.”* 

These targets know you and your solution. 

And they also know about what your competition is offering. 

But they’re on the fence. 

And haven’t yet pulled the trigger. 

**Level 5 \- Most Aware Target**

*“The customer knows of your product—knows what it does—knows he wants it. At this point, he just hasn’t gotten around to buying it yet.”* 

These targets know your solution and want to buy it. 

(Note: If you guys analyze my emails when I was pitching this course to you, I knew most of you lived in this level (because you knew me and what my course was about) so all I had to do was increase the urgency ($93 for the first 49 people then price goes up) and I knew you’d buy.)

—

Those are the 5 levels of target awareness. 

(And we’ll be using these levels alongside market sophistication to craft our irresistible 6-7 figure marketing message later.)

*“But wait, Tej\! We don’t even have a product or service to sell yet. How are we supposed to figure out if our target knows our solution?”*

If you already have a product or service you want to sell using this 3-step process, then you can apply the above levels to a tee. 

But if you don’t, no worries. 

Since we don’t have a solution yet, our target’s awareness would only live in Levels 1-3. 

Here’s how to find out the exact level your target’s awareness resides in. 

**(Step-By-Step Guide) How To Determine Your Target’s Awareness Level:**

**Step (1) Dive deep into the problems you’re solving.** 

Note: These are the problems you jotted down when you dug deep into your Target (when you were getting inside their head in Phase A).  

* Is this a common problem?   
* Does my target know he/she has this problem?   
* Are targets easily able to realize they have this problem?

If not, they’re in the clueless level. 

Make a note. 

**Step (2) Dive deep into the solutions available on the marketplace.** 

* Is my target familiar with the solutions available on the marketplace?  
* Do targets understand the differences between the solutions?

If so, they’re most likely in the solution aware target (or greater).  

Make a note. 

**Step (3) Dive deep into your offering (if you already have one).**

* Are we well known?  
* Are we selling to cold/warm/hot traffic? (Cold \= doesn’t know you. Warm \= know you (etc. on your email list) Hot \= love you and buy from you all the time).   
* How likely is it the target will have seen our prior advertising? (most of you will be complete new and going after cold traffic who hasn’t seen your advertising before because you’ve never advertised). 

Then take the “intelligence” you gather. 

And group your target into one of the above 5 levels. 

**Remember:** We don’t have an offer/product to sell yet. We’re just doing up front “intelligence” work to determine what type of offer/product/marketing would resonate the most with our target and generate a shit ton of $$$’s. 

And because we haven’t picked a product to sell it’s important to note that you don’t have to be 100% correct when determining market sophistication or your target’s level of awareness. Just having a general idea will give you a leg up on the entire world because hardly anybody does this (even though it takes just 30 minutes or so). So make sure you do it. 

It’s boring. *But critical.* 

Why? 

It helps you craft killer marketing promotions with complete ease. 

In fact… 

The answers to these questions will help you determine if you should create a direct or indirect promotion, use a Unique Mechanism, what BIG IDEA to use, and so on and so forth. 

Confused?

Don’t be\! That’s what the next 2 steps are about. 

But for now… 

All you need is a specific target (in a starving market) and you need to know your market’s level of sophistication and your target’s level of awareness. 

So if you have a target, know where your market stands, and how much your target knows…  

Then pour up another shot. 

And take it. *Straight.* 

Well done\! 

Our \*INTELLIGENCE\* work is complete. 

Which means we’re ready to \*INVENT\* an irresistible marketing promotion from scratch that’ll pull in BIG $’s (discussed in Part 2). 

Get this right and your target won’t sleep until he or she has paid you $. 

I’m serious. 

**Progress Check: At this point you should know your target, the sophistication level of your market and your target’s level of awareness.** 

**All high level concepts (I know), but we’re going to be getting practical in the next two parts.** 

**See It In Action:** 

In the last section we determined where our market as a whole sits. 

And I picked Level 3 of Market Sophistication.  

Now it’s time to see where Susan’s level of awareness lives.

And this is pretty easy. 

Because the market sophistication level is 3—Susan will know she has a problem (not being able to find love) and solutions exist (dating coaches, info products, counselling or whatever) BUT she won’t have found the RIGHT solution yet (otherwise she wouldn’t be sad and lonely).  

This means: 

Susan level of awareness is Solution Aware (it’s not any level greater because I haven’t picked or created a product to sell yet (lol) so there’s no way she could know about us). 

*This is all we need to do in terms of application for Part 1\.* 

To recap: 

**(1) We know our target:** 40 year old Susan who is a very spiritual, religious, superstitious Christian female that has been cheated on in the past and is alone and struggling to find love.  

**(2) We know the market’s sophistication level:** Level 3\. (Target is being hit with new offers every day. So much noise. Market is full with complete chaos.)

**(3) We know Susan’s level of awareness:** Solution Aware. (Target knows she has a problem. And a solution exists. But she hasn’t yet found the right one that works). 

Cool. Cool. 

If you’re following along by now you should have the above 3 things determined as well. 

If you don’t, slap yourself. 

*Come on man*… I’m legit giving you the game here. All you have to do is follow step-by-step and by the end of this course you’ll have a 6-7 figure promotion ready to launch. 

—

PART 1 is done.

That is legit all I do in part 1\. Nothing more. Nothing less. 

Now we’re going to move to Part 2, where we lay the foundation for our marketing campaign (this is my favorite part).

And in part 3 we’ll dive into the details and bring the promotion to life (we’ll write the actual copy for the long-form sales letter). 

But for now it’s story time… 

In the next little section I reveal a personal story about how I stalk targets and get inside their bed. Check it out. 

**How I Stalk Targets & Get Inside Their Bed**

I started out as a copywriter. In the trenches. 

Problem was, I sucked. Bad. 

Yes I could write. 

But I couldn’t convert. 

Till I did this… 

But first, a little back story. 

I’m not a slick talker or even an extrovert. But I’ve always been good selling one-to-one. It’s easy. Instead of viewing myself as a salesperson, I view myself as a doctor. 

All I do is… 

1\. Listen  
2\. Find out the prospect’s symptoms   
3\. If my solution fits her needs, I prescribe it. And close the sale. If it doesn’t, I refer her to my competitor (and gain her trust for future dealings). 

Simple, right?

It worked well. 

But when I started writing copy… 

I couldn’t do this… I wasn’t selling one-to-one anymore… I couldn’t feel my prospect’s pain… so I needed a new approach for getting into my market’s head… 

And fast. 

Because it wouldn’t be long before client’s realized Tej was all talk, no results. So here’s what I did. 

1\. I shut my laptop. Went outside. 

2\. If I was selling a product to the mass market, I would hop on the city bus. With no destination in mind. And sit in the back. And watch people (creepy I know). And tell myself, “this is the market.”

3\. I would see what they were wearing. What they were talking about. What problems they were voicing (if somebody was talking on the cell phone). And I would write down this intel. 

4\. Strike a conversation. Ask questions. Make friends. Be genuinely curious. And keep doing this until I found somebody who was my ideal customer (and represented the market at large). 

5\. Get this person’s name \+ get to know them (10-20 minute bus ride is all it would take).

6\. Run home. Jump on Google. And find an image of someone who resembled this person. 

7\. Print it out. Tape it to my wall. And stick her name on it. 

8\. Ignore everything. And write the sales letter as if I was just speaking to THIS person. 

9\. If I could convince this person, the rest of the market would buy because they were similar. And since I had interacted with this person in real life, I knew what made her tick. What type of headline would get her attention and what type of message would get her to buy. 

10\. Finish the letter and read it while asking: “Would this meet \[person’s name\] needs and get her to buy?” If yes, I knew I had a winner. 

This is how I went from hearing “it ain’t converting man” to “Tej you got room for another project?\! I’ll pay DOUBLE if I have to.” 

Similarly if I was writing a letter to the wealthy, I would drive around West-Vancouver (rich neighborhood) until my “investigation” was complete. 

I know lots of people recommend forums and FB Groups and that’s great advice. 

I had never thought of that at the time (wish I had). But I did the above instead and it worked well. 

Try it. 

And get some fresh air…

And make some friends… 

In the process. 

—

Story is OVER. 

Back to the process we go. 

So you ready to turn your target into 6-7 figures?

Sweet\!

Here comes the fun part (aka my favorite\!). 

It’s when we turn dirt into gold. 

(Part 1 is all about collecting dirt aka “intelligence”. Now we can take that dirt and turn it into gold. Then in Part 3 we’ll bring everything to life. And transform the gold into cold hard cash\!). 

Got it?

Let’s keep it rockin’. 

**Part 2 \- Turning Dirt Into Gold** 

**Rundown** 

![][image6]

This is the fun part. 

Where BIG money is created.

Where BIG businesses are born.

Where BIG campaigns are made. 

Yet hardly anybody knows about this step… 

I mean, some people do (and they’re usually earning 7 to 8 figures a year). 

But the vast majority of the market?

I have no idea what they’re doing. And from their low conversion numbers, it’s not surprising to me why I can usually beat em. And leave em on the side of the street. *Bruised and bloody.* 

Good news for you is you’re about to learn the game. 

Everything that goes into building a 6-7 figure marketing promotion (from scratch). 

Ready to get cookin’? 

Hit the button above and let’s keep it moving (so you can quickly learn what you need to know and can start applying it to make the BIG bucks\!). 

**\[The Complete Process\] My 7 Building Blocks** 

Every 6+ figure marketing campaign you “invent” needs 7 things. 

I call these the building blocks. 

Most marketing campaigns fail because they don’t have these 7 things. Heck they usually only have 2 of these 7 things (which is why most people \*struggle\* with marketing). 

Here are the building blocks (and this is the exact order I follow when bringing these building blocks to life): 

**1\. BIG PROBLEM**

**2\. BIG IDEA**

**3\. IRRESISTIBLE OFFER**

**4\. UNIQUE SELLING POINT (USP)**

**5\. BIG PROMISE**

**6\. UNIQUE MECHANISM**

**7\. PROOF**

**Note:** We’re going to take the work we did in Part 1 and use those insights to “invent” these 7 things (I don’t care if you’re doing dropshipping or running a marketing agency—you need to make sure your offering has these 7 things. Period). 

These 7 things in a nutshell are ALL you need to scheme up 6-7 figure promotions with complete ease (the better you are at crafting these 7 things, the more money you’ll make until the end of time). I could leave it at that and you’d be ahead of 95% of the market. 

But this is just “theory”. 

Nothing practical about it. 

And I don’t like that.

So we’re going to get practical. 

*Very practical.* 

I’m going to break down each of these 7 building blocks in their own respective section (and show you how to determine these for your own products and services\!). 

And I’m also going to build out these 7 things for the marketing promotion I’m creating inside this course (don’t forget about Susan bro). 

Follow along.

Put into action what you’re learning.

And your competition will have NO CLUE what hit em. 

Trust moi. (Note: Never listen to people who say “trust moi” \- they’re almost bullshitting you 99% of the time. But what about me? Come on man… I wouldn’t do you like that\! I’m a part of the 1% and will prove it to you by the end of this course.)

**1\. BIG PROBLEM**

You know why we targeted starving markets in Part 1? 

Because starving markets have BIG problems. 

And BIG problems \= BIG money (I have this written down on a sticky note and I keep it near because it’s the truth). 

![][image7]

So the first ingredient your \*marketing soup\* MUST HAVE is a BIG PROBLEM. 

If you don’t have a BIG PROBLEM, your target won’t be \*motivated\* to take action. 

Now, I know this ingredient sounds obvious. 

However, you wouldn’t believe how many “marketers” try cooking up a batch of “killer marketing soup” and forget to throw this in (it’s the FIRST INGREDIENT you have to obsess over—because without it there is no 6-7 figure marketing promotion). 

Why is a BIG PROBLEM so important?

**Because a person only notices a gated fence AFTER he’s being chased by a red-nosed pitbull.** 

“What?\!” 

Yeah. Reread that again. 

If I’m not being chased by a pitbull, I won’t even acknowledge the gated fence. And will just walk by it. But when you stick a dog after me, then I start looking around to see what fence I can jump to get away from the dog. 

It’s simple. 

But when selling the gated fence people either forget to include a pitbull in their marketing promotion… 

Or they don’t stick the pitbull on you at the right time. 

We’re going to avoid this problem (no pun intended) by making sure our problem is compelling and in the right place. 

So let’s get to it. 

Again, we start at the basics. 

**What exactly is a BIG PROBLEM?** 

A BIG PROBLEM is exactly what it sounds like. 

A problem your target has that he or she is dying to solve. 

**Pro Tip:** The bigger your problem, the less price conscious your target will be. For example: If you’re selling the cure to a deadly disease, you could charge anything (if you were a prick). But if you’re selling a 1% improvement in open rates, your target would be more stingy about the price (and would negotiate every nickel and dime). 

That’s why we only care about BIG PROBLEMS. 

But be warned. 

Most BIG problems aren’t really BIG problems. 

In fact, most problems are just minor nuisances that targets would prefer to live without. But they don’t care enough to pay $ to solve the problem. 

And you know what?

That’s another reason why most marketers fall flat on their face. 

They create BIG promotions over LITTLE nuisances. 

Mistake. 

The success of your marketing promotion is based on the strength of the problem you are solving. Nothing more. Nothing less. (Solve a big enough problem for your target and make them believe you can solve it and it’s a done deal for the most part). 

So which problems do I personally recommend targeting? 

Problems that are biologically rooted. 

Let me explain. 

**Emotions \> Logic.** 

Problems that are biologically rooted are the source of intense emotions. 

Your target’s biologically is literally pushing him or her to solve these problems. 

These make for the best problems. 

**Examples of biologically rooted problems:** 

* Not making enough $$$s (to support your family)  
* Not being able to find a girlfriend/boyfriend (to make a family)  
* Not knowing how to make friends (loneliness)  
* Not being able to lose weight (to increase health longevity)   
* Not being able to prolong physical attractiveness (aging)

Is it any wonder why wealth, health and dating are the BIG 3 markets? 

Nah. 

Each of these markets solve BIG PROBLEMS (and people will do anything to solve these problems. In other words: Spending $$$s isn’t an issue). 

*“But Tej… what if I cannot solve any of these problems?”* 

No worries. 

I run a marketing agency. 

And the problem I solve isn’t any of the above. 

The problem I target is this:

“Tired of spending $$$’s on marketing agencies that promise you the world, but do nothing but burn your money and set you back years?\!”

That’s the problem I stress.

And the people I target are folks who have spent $$$’s on marketing agencies (but got burnt). 

In other words: 

The problem I solve is companies not being able to hit the next level of growth/scale (because they can’t find real marketing help that delivers real results). 

It’s a pretty BIG problem.

And compelling enough to get people to act now.

Because the alternative is business failure\! 

So don’t trip if your problem isn’t biologically rooted. 

Reality is:  

Your target does have a BIG problem. *It’s your job to find it.* 

**(Step-By-Step Guide) How to find your targets BIG problem:** 

**Step (1) Use the intelligence you gathered in step 1 (during your stalking) to make a list of problems. Any problems your target has. Write em down.** 

You know your target. 

You’ve given them a name. 

A background story. 

Got inside their head. 

And created your “Customer Avatar”. 

(We did all this in Part 1.)

And while building your Customer Avatar, you answered the question: 

**“What keeps your target up at night?”** 

The answers to this question are the source of BIG problems. 

So go back to your answers. And review. 

Then write down a few more problems. 

**Step (2) Rank those problems from MOST stressful/urgent to least stressful/urgent.** 

Stressful/urgent \= How badly does your target want to solve this problem. 

The more badly they want to solve it, the more stressful/urgent it is. 

And vice versa. 

**Step (3) The problem at the top of your list is the problem you should target (given it’s a problem that can be solved with a product or service).** 

For example: 

Cancer or diabetes or blindness may be the biggest problem facing your target (but there is no solution). 

So only choose a problem that has a proven solution (because we’re not in the business of selling snake-oil, but in the business of actually helping people solve their problems). 

**How can you tell if it’s a BIG PROBLEM?** 

If NOT solving it will COST greater pain than forking over $XXX to solve it now. 

That’s when you know you’ve hit gold, my friend\! 

Once you do, let’s keep it moving to the next ingredient:

**BIG IDEA\!** 

But before we do, here’s what you need to do right now.

[Download this Google Doc.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eSwmUOwJ_2gBQt8sQkFntnvI_LZSXYJIkGtBdtmB9qc/edit?usp=sharing) 

And fill in the details for your specific promotion. 

Fill the doc up to (and including) the BIG PROBLEM section.  

(we’ll be using this doc to build out our promotion.)

**Progress Check: At this point you should have a target and know what level of sophistication your market lives in, your targets level of awareness, and their BIG PROBLEM.** 

—

**See It In Action:** 

Back to Susan we go. 

Quick recap: 

**(1) We know our target:** 40 year old Susan who is a very spiritual, religious, superstitious Christian female that has been cheated on in the past and is alone and struggling to find love.  

**(2) We know the market and its sophistication level:** Dating/Love market. Level 3\. (Target is being hit with new offers every day. So much noise. Market is full with complete chaos.)

**(3) We know Susan’s level of awareness:** Solution Aware. (Target knows she has a problem. And a solution exists. But she hasn’t yet found the right one that works). 

Now it’s time to determine the BIG PROBLEM Susan already knows she has. 

And it’s actually quite simple. 

(Because we started with a starving market that is hungry for a solution). 

Susan has a lot of problems. But her BIG PROBLEM is this: 

**Missing out on true love and building a family with someone she loves deeply and someone who loves her (remember she’s aging… and alone… and desperate to solve this problem and find her \*soulmate\* because her “biological clock” is ticking).** 

So this is the problem we’re going to help Susan solve. 

**Quick Note:** 

Does it matter other people are also trying to solve the same problem for Susan? No. Of course not. We’re going to solve it better (because we’re building our marketing promotion based on the 7 building blocks required for marketing success—while everyone else is pussyfooting around). 

Again, that’s all I need to do “application” wise (I do everything step-by-step and you should too. Keep it simple because this process is stupid simple). 

Onto the next ingredient. 

**2\. BIG IDEA** 

Before we dive into the BIG IDEA, I want you to read the words of David Ogilvy (one of the greatest ad men to ever live):

*“You will never win fame and fortune unless you invent BIG ideas. It takes a BIG IDEA to attract the attention of consumers and get them to buy your product. Unless your advertising contains a BIG IDEA, it will pass like a ship in the night.”* 

Reread it again. And again. 

Print it out. Glue it to your forehead. Make it your Twitter Bio. 

I don’t care. 

But remember it. 

Because inventing BIG ideas and failing to invent BIG ideas is the difference between earning scraps and making bank. 

I know because: 

When I first got into marketing… I read a few copywriting books… got some clients… and got to work. 

And would write. 

Rewrite.

Write.

Rewrite. 

And what I wrote was great. I loved it. The client loved it. 

But the targets? 

They couldn’t give two fucks. 

It didn’t speak to em. 

Low conversions. 

Fuck. 

Why?

I was selling a product or service instead of selling A BIG IDEA. 

90% of the marketing online fails because it doesn’t contain a BIG IDEA. 

Just facts. 

Nobody focuses on this. 

I don’t know why. 

But without a BIG IDEA your promotion will pass like a ship in the night. 

Just like David Ogilvy said. 

**What exactly is a BIG IDEA?** 

A BIG IDEA is important, exciting and benefit oriented. 

Now, a BIG idea doesn’t and shouldn’t directly be about your product. 

But it should be about something relevant. 

Something memorable. 

Something that will continue to ruffle your targets feathers for a very long time. 

**Why does it have to be exciting?**

We’re living in noisy times. 

Ideas that aren’t exciting don’t even register in our minds. 

Not anymore. 

We’re bombarded by information 24/7. 

All day. Every day. 

Exciting ideas are needed because they make us stop dead in our tracks. 

And take heed of what we just heard. 

(This is the impact we need to have on our target if we want to sell em.)

**Why does it have to be important?**

You can find an exciting idea, but if it’s not *emotionally* important to your target, you’re toast. 

They might care a little. 

But they won’t care enough to pull out their credit card or open PayPal. 

**Why does it have to be benefit-oriented?** 

People are selfish. That’s why. 

“What’s in it for me?” is a question you always have to answer. 

Or you’re leaving $$$’s on the table.

Now those are the main components, but there’s also \*smaller\* components: 

* A BIG IDEA is simple   
* A BIG IDEA is memorable  
* A BIG IDEA is very easy to understand  
* A BIG IDEA is timeless

**Here are examples of BIG IDEAS (I’ve included the full headline and jotted down the BIG IDEA below):** 

**Example 1:**

There’s a New Railroad Across America 

And it’s making some people very rich… 

In fact, one ex-bond trader with a mixed track record made $1.8 million per day for 540 straight days\! 

—

BIG IDEA: A new “money-making” railroad 

**Example 2:**

Napoleon’s Military Spies Discover: 

“THE SPANISH ARMY’S SECRET FOR ROBUST HEART HEALTH”

Spain’s military doctors used this “secret weapon” to transform their soldiers into a front-line superhuman fighting force. 

On this page, discover exactly what it is and how to get some for yourself…

—

BIG IDEA: Spanish army had a secret for robust heart health. 

**Example 3:**

The “Secret Currency” 

How the World’s Wealthiest Families Make Money Even When Stocks, Bonds and Real Estate Lose Value

There is a “secret currency” that exists that lies beyond the reach of any government. 

—

BIG IDEA: “Secret currency” the government cannot control.   
   
Notice how each of these BIG IDEAS make you think, “What the fuck. Really?” 

It piques your curiosity. 

That’s what BIG IDEAS do. 

**So now that we got that out the way, the next question is “how can we tell if something is a BIG IDEA?”** 

Good question. 

Here’s the criteria (according to David Ogilvy): 

**1\. Did it make you gasp when you first saw it?**  
**2\. Do you wish you had thought of it yourself?**  
**3\. Is it unique?**  
**4\. Does it fit the strategy to perfection?**  
**5\. Could it be used for 30 years?** 

Most of the sales pitches you read will be forgotten instantly (because they sell products or services instead of BIG IDEAS). 

Not a shocker. 

But BIG IDEAS are hard to forget. 

They linger in your brain for months and sometimes years to come (you may forget the product or service they’re pitching but you’ll always remember there is a “secret currency” the government doesn’t want you to know about). 

And that’s because the objective of a BIG IDEA is simple: 

To plant a seed in the reader’s mind. A seed they cannot forget. 

Sure they may not buy now, but whenever they keep running into the same problem—they will be reminded of your BIG IDEA every time and buy later. 

Guaranteed. 

**(Step-By-Step Guide) How to invent a BIG IDEA for your promotion** 

*“BIG IDEAS come from the unconscious. This is true in art, in science, and in advertising. But your unconscious has to be well formed, or your idea will be irrelevant. Stuff your conscious mind with information, then unhook your rational thought process.”* 

\- David Ogilvy 

**Step (1) Feed your brain massive amounts of data. Data about your market, your target, current events, future trends.** 

I spend 4 hours going ham. And taking notes. And notes. And notes. 

I’m not looking for anything particular. 

I’m just wearing my “data collection” hat. And gathering ideas. 

**Here are some of the things I punch into Google:** 

“\[my target\] \+ \[future upcoming trends\]” 

“\[my market\]” → read the “news” tab (to see recent events). 

“Bizarre facts about \[market\].”

“New Trends” → and see if any can be directly tied to my target (and the market I’m going after). 

I also spend time digging deep into blogs in my market. And see what ideas the author is talking about. These provide a wealth of intel. 

“\[my niche\] \+ blogs”

**Step (2) Use my “data” to brainstorm BIG IDEAS** 

I do this right after I finish my data collection session. 

Why?

My brain is fried. I want to fry it even more. And push it to the limit. 

So based off all the data I have, I’ll brainstorm 10 BIG IDEAS. 

Anything that comes to mind, I’ll write down. 

Then?

I’ll write down 10 more ideas. 

But here’s the thing… 

All these ideas SUCK—because my brain is worn out and can’t think straight. 

But that’s fine. In fact, it’s good. 

Because after I’ve come up with 20 or so BIG IDEAS, I shut the laptop. Get up. And fuck off—because my job is done. It’s finished. It’s over. 

And I’ll go shoot hoops. Take a nap. Eat. Drink. Whatever. Doesn’t matter. 

But I won’t “work”. 

Instead I’ll let my subconscious work for me. 

And it will… 

Because once I remove myself from the nitty gritty I’ll be presented with a BIG IDEA randomly while I’m doing something else. And I’ll be able to connect pieces I previously never saw. 

And when I do, I will have given birth to a BIG IDEA for my marketing promotion. 

Works like a charm. 

So I encourage you to follow the same process right now. 

**1\. Immerse your brain**  
**2\. Unplug**  
**3\. Receive the BIG IDEA** 

That’s how you come up with BIG IDEAS (this process hasn’t let me down yet). 

Do it now. 

**Reminder:** Once you have a BIG IDEA for your promotion, go here to update your 6 figure promo doc: 

[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eSwmUOwJ\_2gBQt8sQkFntnvI\_LZSXYJIkGtBdtmB9qc/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eSwmUOwJ_2gBQt8sQkFntnvI_LZSXYJIkGtBdtmB9qc/edit?usp=sharing) 

Now we’re slowly, but surely bringing everything together. 

And the end product is going to be a 6-7 marketing promotion that converts like gangbusters. 

So let’s keep it rocking. 

And jump to the next ingredient our killer marketing soup needs:

An irresistible offer.  

**Progress Check: At this point you should have:** 

* A target  
* Know what level of sophistication your market lives in   
* Know your targets level of awareness  
* Your targets BIG PROBLEM   
* A BIG IDEA that would make your target stop dead in its tracks

**See It In Action:** 

Back to Susan we go. 

And I’m just going to come out and say it: 

This is the most important ingredient.

Period. 

Why?

I know my target. 

I know where the market stands. 

I know how much my target knows. 

And it’s obvious. 

Competition is crazy in the dating/relationships vertical (and the love/spiritual niche). 

So if I have any hope of standing out (and making a killing in this STARVING market), I need to sell a BIG IDEA.

A BIG idea my target hasn’t heard before. 

Sounds difficult? 

Not really. 

BIG IDEAS are already out there. I just have to find it. And recognize it when I see it. 

So that’s exactly what I did. 

I researched my niche (spiritual/love) and jotted down intel after intel after intel. 

Pages full. 

And after hours and hours of digging… 

I stumbled across something in this niche. 

Something VERY interesting.

And BIG. 

So compelling in fact… 

I got \*marketing goose-bumps\* that told me I was about to make a shit ton of $$$’s with this BIG Idea. 

**What did I find?** 

I found the idea of “Saint Valentine.” 

At first, I dismissed this. 

But it kept coming up. 

So I dug. *Deeper.* 

And here’s what I discovered: 

* St. Valentine is the inspiration behind Valentine's Day (Feb 14\)  
* He is synonymous with love because he was martyred for love   
* He made \*MIRACLES of love happen for people who were down and out and had lost all hope of ever finding true love. 

Sounds sappy?\! 

Sure. 

It did to me as well. 

But it won’t to my target (because she’s a member of this niche and would have heard about St. Valentine or be open to the idea). 

And that’s another important point to make: 

**You have to remove your prejudices when marketing to targets.** 

*You have to become the target.* 

And find BIG IDEAS that speak to the target, not to YOU. 

Anyway the idea of “St. Valentine” wasn’t the big idea itself. 

No. 

It was the segway. 

Because Saint Valentine led me towards marketing gold. 

Let me explain: 

After digging deeper into Saint Valentine (a prominent figure in the spiritual/christian/love niche) I discovered that the relics (body) of Saint Valentine is buried in Dublin, Ireland at a Church. 

And more importantly: Christians in need of love make a pilgrimage every year to visit Saint Valentine’s shrine—where they make a wish for their love related desires to be granted. 

![][image8]

And according to many people, this works. And St. Valentine’s \*energy\* helps deliver miracles of love. From uniting people to new lovers. To getting people married. To helping people get back with an ex. 

Whatever. 

Again… 

I suspend all my personal beliefs. I don’t care whether I believe this. Or not. 

Only thing I care about is what my target believes. 

And since she’s in this niche, I know she believes in this. 

So this is the exact BIG IDEA I’m going to use to build out my killer 6-7 figure marketing promotion. 

Here’s the BIG IDEA:

“ST VALENTINE’S \*ENERGY\* DELIVERS MIRACLES OF LOVE\!” 

**Note:** 

I’m not going to sell a product or service. 

I’m going to sell my target this BIG idea. 

But in order to do that, I need an offer aka a product or service to sell. 

So that’s what we’re going to build next. 

(Notice how only NOW are we concerned about WHAT to sell.)

**3\. IRRESISTIBLE OFFER**

Want to know something? 

Product selection is important. Really important. 

But it’s not the most important thing when it comes to marketing (and actually making sales). 

The most important thing is solving a BIG PROBLEM and pushing a BIG idea. 

Yep. 

So only after we’ve determined our target’s BIG PROBLEM and have come up with a compelling and rich BIG IDEA that’d get our target to stop dead in his or her tracks, do we start thinking about what to sell. 

Most people approach this ass backwards. 

And fail. 

We’re not like most people. 

So let’s keep it pushing. And put together an irresistible offer. 

**What makes for an irresistible offer?** 

It’s simple. *Too simple.* 

**Value \> Price** 

That’s all there is to it. 

When the \*perceived value\* is 10x higher than the price (or more), you have an irresistible offer. 

This is all your offer has to achieve. 

In other words, you just have to make it easier for the target to say “yes” than “no.” 

**Examples of irresistible offers:**

* **Amazon Prime:** $99/year; FREE shipping on all Amazon Prime products; a 30-day free trial, unlimited music streaming and other bonuses

* **Costco:** Buy in bulk and save a shit ton of $$$s for a yearly membership fee of just $60

* **How To Invent 6 Figure Promotions With One Eye Closed**: Not to stroke my own ego but I’ve tried to make this an irresistible offer by charging you $93 in exchange for my 3 part process, 2 promotions that pulled in 6 figures, live demonstration of me building a promo from scratch inside the course and 100 hacks to make your copy convert. 

Now that we’ve covered the basics—the question becomes—how do we find an irresistible offer to sell? 

Good question. 

Here’s how I do it: 

**Step (1) Research the competition**

Start here. 

Figure out what your competition is already selling to your target (or trying to sell). 

Is it courses?

Is it books?

It is pills?

Is it seminars?

Is it bootcamps?

Is it coaching?

Doesn’t matter what it is. 

Write it down. 

Get a general idea of the “offerings” in your market. 

**Step (2) Review your BIG PROBLEM and BIG IDEA.**

Ask yourself: 

What product or service can I create to alleviate the tension created by the BIG IDEA (or take advantage of the benefits of the BIG IDEA) and solve the BIG PROBLEM my target is plagued with? 

That’s all you have to do. 

Brainstorm. 

Use what the competition is selling as a guide. 

And create your list. 

Rank it from best to worse. 

Till you have something compelling to sell. 

And you’re on your way. 

For example:

**Maybe the BIG IDEA is…** 

“50% of accountants will be jobless by 2020 because of artificial intelligence.” 

**Maybe the product or service you can sell is:** 

A nootropic targeted for entry-level accountants that increases their focus, concentration and productivity levels so they can survive the onslaught of artificial intelligence. And keep their job. 

You get the idea? 

Job here is to come up with a rough idea for an offer (we’ll bring it to life and make it compelling in just a moment). 

So think long and hard. About what you want to sell. What you have to offer (that could help your target solve his or her BIG PROBLEM). 

**Note:** If you already have an offer, that’s great. But go through the above step-by-step process anyway and see if you can strengthen your offer based on what you now know (hint: you can). 

**See It In Action:**  

Back to Susan we go. 

Alright… 

Quick recap: 

**(1) We know our target:** 40 year old Susan who is a very spiritual, religious, superstitious Christian female that has been cheated on in the past and is alone and struggling to find love.  

**(2) We know the market and its sophistication level:** Dating/Love market. Level 3\. (Target is being hit with new offers every day. So much noise. Market is full with complete chaos.)

**(3) We know Susan’s level of awareness:** Solution Aware. (Target knows she has a problem. And a solution exists. But she hasn’t yet found the right one that works). 

**(4) We know Susan’s BIG PROBLEM:** Missing out on true love and building a family with someone she loves deeply and someone who loves her (remember she’s aging… and alone… and desperate to solve this problem and find her \*soulmate\* because her “biological clock” is ticking). 

**(5) We know our BIG IDEA:** Saint Valentine’s \*ENERGY\* delivers miracles of love. 

Now it’s time to create an offer (which aligns with our BIG IDEA and solves our targets BIG PROBLEM). 

But before we do… 

It’s important to look over our findings. 

We already know our target is solution aware. 

And the market sophistication is in Level 3\. 

Which tells us our target has been assaulted with offer after offer and hasn’t been able to solve her problem. So we cannot sell the same thing as the competition because Susan would just ignore it. 

Instead, we need to sell something different or better (and proven). 

So what I’m going to do is see what the competition is selling. 

Find something exciting. 

And then create a \*TWIST\* on it so it’s perceived as \*NEW\* to Susan.  

Here’s what the competition is selling (with great success): 

* Info products (how to find true love/how to keep a man attracted/blah blah)  
* 1-on-1 coaching (dating coach)  
* Counselling   
* Love charms  
* Love medals   
* Dating sites 

You get the idea. 

Now that I know what my competition is selling and I know my BIG IDEA (the idea that’d get Susan excited) I basically need to find a product or service that’d perfectly align with my BIG IDEA. 

And going off the list above… 

What I’m going to pick is a \*LOVE MEDAL\*. 

This may not sound \*irresistible\* to you yet (and it’s not)... 

But soon it will be (because we’ll bring it to life with the next few ingredients). 

**4\. UNIQUE SELLING POINT (USP)**

USP \= How you \*position\* your product/service on the market. 

This is a crucial ingredient because most people think marketing is difficult. *It’s not.* 

You know why they think it’s difficult?

Because of “saturation.” 

Should you be scared of saturation?

Yes and no. 

If you’re creative and good at coming up with unique selling points, then you don’t need to worry about saturation. *At all.* 

You can always “scheme” your way out of saturation (I do it daily and will show you how). 

But if you’re not creative, don’t worry… 

All hope isn’t lost. 

Because I’m going to teach you about unique selling points. And how to craft larger than life unique selling points that actually matter (and \*position\* your offer as the best thing on the market since sliced bread). 

Let’s start with the basics. 

**What is a USP?** 

This is how Google defines it: 

“A unique selling proposition (USP, also seen as unique selling point) is a factor that differentiates a product from its competitors, such as the lowest cost, the highest quality or the first-ever product of its kind. A USP could be thought of as “what you have that competitors don’t.” 

Is Google right?

100%.

But this definition is only half applicable (in my opinion). 

Why?

Because it only lists common USP’s like “low cost, high quality, first of its kind”... 

And honestly? 

These aren’t really effective online. 

Targets don’t care (especially if your market is in Level 3 of market sophistication or beyond). 

You need something BIGGER and BETTER. 

So let’s stick to the second part of the definition: 

A USP is what you have that your competitors don’t. 

In other words, *this is your juice.* 

So ask yourself: 

**What does your offer have that your competitors don’t?** 

Is this exciting?

Powerful?

Compelling?

How would it position you on the market? 

These are the questions you need to answer. 

Need some inspiration?

**Here are examples of powerful USP’s:** 

* **TOMS shoes** \- A child in need gets a new pair of shoes for every purchase you make.   
* **Nerd Fitness** \- Lots of fitness websites out there, but this one is unique because it’s fitness for nerds.   
* **Comedic Bizman (Twitter handle)** \- Lots of business accounts are on Twitter, but how many of them are comedic? 

Get the idea?

Cool. Cool. 

Now I’m going to show you how to come up with killer USPs (for your products or services). 

**(Step-By-Step Guide) How To Come Up With Killer USP’s:** 

Take 2 UNRELATED IDEAS and COMBINE THEM. 

That’s honestly all you have to do… 

It’s so simple. 

So effective. 

It works so damn well. 

You wouldn’t believe it. 

So do it. 

How exactly?

By combining YOUR BIG IDEA w/ your OFFER. 

**Note:** I posted a tweet about this earlier w/ an example. Check it out. 

 ![][image9]

**Progress Check: At this point you should:**

* **Have a target**  
* **Know what level of sophistication your market lives in**  
* **Know your targets level of awareness**  
* **Have created a BIG problem**  
* **Have a BIG idea**  
* **Built an irresistible offer**  
* **Come up with a compelling USP**

**See It In Action:** 

I decided to sell a LOVE MEDAL to Susan (in the previous section). 

Now problem with this is… 

Lots of competitors also sell love medals. Or “good luck” charms that are worn to attract love and connection. 

So we don’t want to be seen as another LOVE MEDAL in the eyes of our target (because Susan is in LEVEL 3 of market sophistication and has already heard a bunch of different offers like these and it won’t be enough to get her to buy). 

**Note:** If we were in the first level of market sophistication, we could make big money selling a simple love medal because we’re the only ones in the market. But we’re not anymore. 

So our love medal (offer) has to be unique. 

**How do we make it unique?**

By combining 2 unrelated ideas. 

**What ideas should we combine?** 

*Our offer \+ BIG idea.*

Our offer \= Love Medal

Big Idea \= St. Valentine’s \*energy\* delivers miracles of love. 

The end \*product\* looks like this:  

Our medal is St. Valentine’s Medal of love. 

No other LOVE MEDAL on the market positions themselves like this. 

Or sells this. 

In other words:

We just \*INVENTED\* an entirely “NEW” solution and formed a completely new market category all because of our powerful and unique USP. 

Get it?

That’s all you have to do. 

Shit is brain dead simple. 

And easy. 

And effective (you’ll see). 

Onto the next ingredient. 

**5\. BIG PROMISE**

I’m not going to waste your time (or mine) by making this section extra long—when it doesn’t need to be. 

Why? 

Because the BIG promise is just the opposite of the BIG problem. 

If the big problem is loneliness and not being able to attract a hot girl—the big promise is getting a girlfriend. 

If the big problem is not making enough $$$’s—the big promise is making $$$’s. 

Catch my drift?

It’s the PROMISE your SOLUTION makes (the benefit the buyer gets from buying your product or service). 

And it needs to be captivating and compelling enough to get people to take action. 

Most people fail because:

They include too many promises. 

And they’re usually small promises. 

Too many small promises will pass like a ship in the night. 

Stick to:

**ONE BIG IDEA.**

**ONE BIG PROBLEM.**

**ONE BIG PROMISE.** 

That’s all you need\! 

Your marketing promotion shouldn’t contain TOO MANY promises.  

In fact, it should just contain ONE. 

Because it’s easy to understand.

And generates more sales.

Keep it simple. 

Here’s how. 

**(Step-By-Step Guide) How To Come Up With A Big Promise**

Take your target’s BIG PROBLEM and flip it. 

How?

Think about where your target will be AFTER they’ve used/bought your offer. 

If big problem \= losing your job to artificial intelligence

Big promise \= keeping your job and prospering. 

That’s it\!

Nothing fancy. 

Figure out your big promise. Now. 

[Then update your 6 figure Google Doc.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eSwmUOwJ_2gBQt8sQkFntnvI_LZSXYJIkGtBdtmB9qc/edit?usp=sharing) 

**Progress Check: At this point you should:**

* **Have a target**  
* **Know what level of sophistication your market lives in**  
* **Know your targets level of awareness**  
* **Have created a big problem**  
* **Have a big idea**  
* **Built an offer**  
* **Created a USP**  
* **Come up with a big promise.** 

Have you?

If not, go back and get your ish together. 

**—**

**See It In Action:** 

Again this will be super short because there’s not much to it. 

Susan’s big problem \= not being able to find true love. 

Our big promise (to Susan) \= fulfilling all her love-related desires. 

How exactly do we deliver on our promise (and prove it to Susan)? 

That’s what the next 2 ingredients are for. 

**6\. UNIQUE MECHANISM**  

This is the ingredient you sprinkle into the marketing soup because once you do:

Your target will buy from you and nobody else (sorry competition\!). 

I mean it. 

A unique mechanism is truly that powerful. 

**What is a unique mechanism?** 

*“A unique method, system or process behind your products or service that brings your prospects the outcome they desire.”* 

In other words: 

It’s the “how” behind your promise. 

How do you actually deliver on the promise you make?

How does it work? 

What secret sauce do you use?

By inventing a “secret sauce” and giving it a “name” you corner your target to buy from you (instead of the competition) because the secret sauce is what makes the solution possible (and your competitor doesn’t have this secret sauce). 

If there’s no secret sauce, there’s no sales. 

A great secret sauce will win you a bulk of the market. 

And you know why?

**Because it makes your marketing believable.** 

This is more important now than ever.

I mean, just look around. 

All you see are big promises. 

“Lose weight\!”

“Make money\!” 

“Get a 6 pack\!”

“Find love\!”

Targets have heard these promises. Over and over and over again. 

And you know what?

They don’t believe em anymore. 

That’s why your marketing promotion needs a Unique Mechanism. 

Because it explains to the target HOW your product or service will deliver on the promise you make.

Get it?

Good. 

Because once you include a unique mechanism, your target won’t be able to help but think: 

“Gee… I’ve never heard of this \*secret sauce\* before… but it sounds interesting and effective… *maybe this is what will finally solve my problem*\!”

Once this thought crosses your target’s mind (it will if you create the right unique mechanism) the sale is closed. 

Done dealz.  

**Example of secret sauce/unique mechanism:** 

I AM 61 POUNDS LIGHTER...NEVER A HUNGRY MINUTE

“Read The Astonishing Experience Of New York Food Expert with the Famous Eat-and-Reduce Plan.” 

—

What’s the Unique Mechanism in this headline? 

\[scroll down for answer\] 

Eat-and-Reduce Plan. 

Why?

Target may have tried to lose weight before (with little-to-no results). 

And he or she may have tried many things. 

But this headline makes the promise the person in question lost 61 pounds because of the eat and reduce plan. And since the target hasn’t tried this plan… he or she is forced to think “maybe this is the magic solution.” 

Do you follow?

Cool. 

Now let’s discuss how you can find your very own Unique Mechanism (it’s stupid simple).  

**(Step-By-Step Guide) How to find your powerful Unique Mechanism:**

**Step (1) Ask yourself: How does my “offer” deliver on the “promise” it makes?** 

In other words, how does your solution work? 

Maybe it’s because of a “secret formula”. 

Maybe it’s because of a “special ingredient.”

Maybe it’s because of a “rare technology.”

Maybe it’s because of “how long you age the wine for.” 

Doesn’t matter. 

Figure out the “how”. 

Write it down. 

**Step (2) Turn this “how” into your secret sauce by giving it a compelling name (optional).** 

You don’t have to do this. 

I don’t always. 

But if you want—you can give your unique mechanism a compelling name. 

So it stands out. 

And is easily memorable—once we write our sales letter (more on that in Part 3).

**Update:** 

We’re almost finished with Part 2\. 

In fact, we only have one more key ingredient left: 

Proof.

Click the button above to move on. 

And let’s sprinkle a little proof into our marketing promotion so we can CRUSH IT (in Part 3).

**Progress Check: At this point you should:**

* Have a target  
* Know what level of sophistication your market lives in  
* Know your targets level of awareness   
* Have a big problem  
* Have a big idea  
* Have an irresistible offer  
* Have a USP  
* Have a big promise  
* Have a unique mechanism 

And you should have updated your [6 figure Google Doc.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eSwmUOwJ_2gBQt8sQkFntnvI_LZSXYJIkGtBdtmB9qc/edit?usp=sharing)

**See It In Action:** 

I’m not in the business of selling snake oil. 

So if I’m going to sell a ST. VALENTINE LOVE MEDAL to my target Susan. 

And use the BIG IDEA: “St. Valentines \*ENERGY\* helps deliver miracles of love to whoever wears it…

Then I need to ensure my love medal actually delivers on this promise.  

In other words:

I need a compelling unique mechanism. 

And a way to \*capture\* the \*energy\* of St. Valentine. 

So you know what I’m going to do?

This may sounds extreme to you, but nobody else will do this. So it’ll practically guarantee a solid competitive advantage. 

I’m going to include in the love medal actual soil from Saint Valentine’s shrine in Dublin, Ireland. 

And sell the idea: 

“The reason this love medal will fulfill all your love-related desires is because it contains soil from St. Valentines shrine—the exact shrine where thousands of miracles of love have taken place. So if you cannot visit Dublin, Ireland yourself and still want miracles of love, then wear this around your neck and be surrounded by St. Valentine’s unique energies and let em manifest love into your life.” 

You like that?

See how compelling it is?

Dope. Dope. 

Now how am I going to get this soil?

I didn’t have to. My client got it.

Boo yeah. 

Again, this is all the application I need to do thus far. 

Let’s keep the train moving. 

**7\. PROOF**

Proof is the last ingredient our \*killer marketing soup\* needs. 

Why?

People don’t trust you. 

This is fact. 

People don’t trust marketing. 

This is fact. 

But here’s the kicker: 

They want to. Desperately. 

Yep. 

They desperately want to believe the promises you’re making. 

Why?

Because they desperately want to solve the problem they’re facing. 

So it’s your job to convince em. 

How?

With proof.

Lots of it. 

Use whatever you can to prove that your product or service really does deliver on its promise. 

**(Step-By-Step Guide) How to come up with powerful proof:**

Simply include one or more of the following into your promotion:

1\. Success stories  
2\. Case studies  
3\. Testimonials   
4\. Social proof 

Don’t have these?

GET EM\! Do whatever it takes. 

(If you don’t and you’re just starting—no biggie\! You’ll still be able to kill it but the faster you get proof, the faster you’ll blow up). 

Here are examples of great proof:

Got it?

Awesome. 

**Progress Check: At this point you should:**

* Have a target  
* Know what level of sophistication your market lives in  
* Know your targets level of awareness   
* Have a big problem  
* Have a big idea  
* Have an irresistible offer  
* Have a USP  
* Have a big promise  
* Have a unique mechanism   
* Proof

[And have this entire 6 figure doc filled out](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eSwmUOwJ_2gBQt8sQkFntnvI_LZSXYJIkGtBdtmB9qc/edit?usp=sharing) (so we can pull everything together and write a solid ass sales letter in the next and final part that pulls in 6-7 figures). 

**See It In Action:** 

Back to our work-in-process example. 

I cracked open some books. Read some articles. 

And found some proof. 

Proof of what?

St. Valentine’s power to fulfill people’s love related desires. 

I’ve jotted all these success stories, testimonials, and hard data onto a Google Doc and will be using these to bring my promotion to life in Part 3\. 

(I’m also going to use the story of St. Valentine as proof in my long-form sales letter. Because the more I sell the target on the idea of St. Valentine, the more compelling my sales pitch will be. And the more sales I’ll generate.) 

So that’s it\! 

All I had to do in Part 2 is now done. 

Here’s a quick rundown of where we stand with this promo: 

**(1) We know our target:** 40 year old Susan who is a very spiritual, religious, superstitious Christian female that has been cheated on in the past and is alone and struggling to find love.  

**(2) We know the market and its sophistication level:** Dating/Love market. Level 3\. (Target is being hit with new offers every day. So much noise. Market is full with complete chaos.)

**(3) We know Susan’s level of awareness: Solution Aware.** (Target knows she has a problem. And a solution exists. But she hasn’t yet found the right one that works). 

**(4) We know Susan’s BIG problem:** Missing out on true love and building a family with someone she loves deeply and someone who loves her (remember she’s aging… and alone… and desperate to solve this problem and find her \*soulmate\* because her “biological clock” is ticking). 

**(5) We know our BIG idea:** Saint Valentine’s \*ENERGY\* delivers miracles of love. 

**(6) We know what we’re selling:** Love Medal. 

**(7) We know our USP (positioning):** St. Valentine’s Medal of Love. 

**(8) We know our BIG promise:** Our St. Valentine Medal carries “love” energy and will fulfill all the love-related desires of the wearer. 

**(9) We know our unique mechanism:** The reason this love medal will fulfill all your love-related desires is because it contains soil from St. Valentines shrine—the exact shrine where thousands of miracles of love have taken place. So if you cannot visit Dublin, Ireland yourself and still want miracles of love, then wear this around your neck and be surrounded by St. Valentine’s unique energies and let em manifest love into your life.

**(10) We have found proof:** Testimonials from people who have used the powers of St. Valentine’s energy/shrine to fulfill their love related desires.

Now it’s time to actually write the marketing promotion.

And bring it to life\! 

See how writing doesn’t come till the last step? 

The beauty is our marketing promotion is pretty much already written—we don’t even have to know much “copywriting” to bring it to life. 

I’ll show you what I mean in the next step… 

But before I do, I want to lift the roof of the car and give you a rough idea of how you can start using this *way of thinking* to crush it\! 

Click the button to check out the quick guide \+ an activity. 

**How To Make $1M in 2020** 

I felt an idea making love to my brain. 

It was good. *Too good to give away.* 

But I don’t care. 

I’m going to tell you anyway. 

Why? 

A few reasons: 

1\. I actually want you to make $’s and succeed: there’s more than enough for all. 

2\. Sharing this with you will give you a solid indication of how to think about online business. And how to “invent” 6 and 7 figure marketing campaigns on auto-pilot *(understand this and you’ll be ahead of 99% of people trying to make money online. No bullshit)*. 

3\. I’ve never been a fan of people who are “stingy” about sharing information. 

Now that we got the juices of excitement flowing through you, let’s pull back the curtains and show you how to make $1M in 2020\.

But first, there’s something you need to know (don’t worry… I’ll be quick): 

Most people suck at online biz because they go about it wrong. 

Here’s what they do: 

A. Find or create a product.   
B. Find a market for that product.  
C. Use mediocre marketing (listing benefits and features) to sell it. 

*This works* (sometimes)*.*

But you’ll never hit a grand slam. You’ll make enough money to quit your day job. But not enough to stunt on the people who shittalked you in high school. 

If you want to stunt (or just become a killer marketer), then you have to do things a little *differently*…  

To show you what I mean, I’m going to reveal how to make $1M in 2020 by telling you the idea and how I would execute it step-by-step (don’t worry so much about the idea… just pay careful attention to the strategy behind it).

**Step 1: Pick a target.** 

My target for this idea: Entry-level accountants working at BIG 4 companies.  

(be as specific as possible) 

**Step 2: Scheme up BIG IDEAS instead of what products to sell.** 

Here’s something every killer marketer already knows: 

Products and services don’t sell. 

*BIG IDEAS do.* 

If you want to make $1M/year, you need a BIG IDEA. 

Put on your thinking cap. Open your eyes. And raise your awareness. 

And ask yourself simple questions like:

*“What do entry-level accountants working at the BIG 4 give a fuck about?”*  
*“What keeps them up at night?”*  
*“What do they want?”* 

Once you ask yourself these questions, you’ll be buzzing with ideas. 

*But none of these ideas will be BIG* (not big enough to pull in 6-7 figures with just one marketing campaign)*.* 

To scheme up a BIG idea, you have to be an observant motherfucker. 

And pay attention to the times. Think about what trends are popping up. *What trends are likely to be big (and will tap into universal appeal)*. 

Don’t worry. 

I’m not going to leave you with BIG IDEA blue balls, I’m revealing every step of the process so here’s what trends came to my mind: 

* Virtual reality   
* Artificial intelligence  
* Outsourcing  
* Voice  
* Etc. 

Now I would dig into these deeper to see if I can pull out any nuggets of gold. 

How? 

I would just Google: 

Virtual reality \+ accountants.   
Artificial intelligence \+ accountants.   
Outsourcing \+ accountants.  
Voice \+ accountants. 

And see if I hit on anything. 

I ran a quick Google search and didn’t find anything for most of the trends above. 

But when I dug a little deeper into artificial intelligence here’s what I did find: 

*“Graduate recruitment at auditors and accountants could fall by as much as 50% by 2020 due to the impact of artificial intelligence, according to a top executive of “Big Four” accountant EY.” \- Business Insider* 

Hmm. *Interesting.* 

If you have any marketing talent running through your veins, you know this is the closest thing to marketing gold you’ll ever find. 

Why? 

* Human beings HATE losing anything (let alone their job)

* Artificial intelligence is a “scary” topic and it makes people insecure (because they don’t want to be “replaced” by robots… or worse lose out on positions to their more talented peers when “downsizing” occurs)

* All the knowledge workers I know (the smart ones at least) are already making moves to ensure they’ll be “safe” when artificial intelligence sweeps through the accounting industry (and other industries) and takes away 50% of the current jobs (this means they’re scared shitless)

So that’s perfecto. 

It has everything you need to “invent” a BIG IDEA. 

In fact, the BIG idea is already created for you. 

You don’t even have to do anything. 

Here’s the BIG idea: 

“Ernst & Young Executive Says 50% Of Entry-Level Accountants Will Be Jobless Because Of Artificial Intelligence By 2020.” 

Done deelz. 

**Step 3: Find or create a product that relieves the tension created by the BIG idea.** 

Only now should you worry about finding a product to sell. 

Why? 

Because now that you have a target and a BIG idea, it’s not only easier to come up with a killer product to sell… *but also 100% easier to market and actually make BIG money (because you’re not in the business of selling the “product” but the “BIG idea”)*. 

So start brainstorming: 

*What products or services could help relieve some of the tension created by the BIG idea?* 

Well, the real issue here is accountants are scared to lose their jobs and will do anything they can to gain an “edge” over their peers. 

So what products or services can give accountants a mental edge? 

Well, let’s brainstorm: 

* Books  
* Courses  
* Mentors   
* Software

All these are pretty boring. 

*Nothing compelling*. *Nothing new and exciting.* 

Let’s keep brainstorming: 

* Random idea  
* Random idea  
* Random idea  
* Nootropics  
* Random idea

*Ah ha\!* 

Nootropics\! Now we’re onto something. 

How about we find or create a nootropic for accountants that enhances their mental clarity, productivity, and focus so they can SURVIVE the onslaught of artificial intelligence and be a part of the 50% of accountants who gets to KEEP their job (instead of losing it to artificial intelligence/more smarter peers)? 

Interesting stuff, Tej.  

**Step 4: Find a nootropic that actually fucking works (no sleezy marketing practices please)**

This is probably the hardest part. 

I’ve personally never used nootropics (I just get a haircut when I need to feel better lmao).

So don’t know much about this industry.

But I know enough to know most people are just peddling the same ingredients and selling bullshit. 

*Don’t sell bullshit.* 

Actually sell stuff that’ll help your target market (or don’t sell at all). 

So in this case I’d find a killer nootropic that actually works. And would brand it 100% for accountants who are looking for a “mental edge”/a way to survive the onslaught of artificial intelligence. 

**Step 5: Use your BIG idea to market it** 

The marketing is already done. 

You just don’t know it. 

The BIG idea is already created. 

Now you just have to pair it with a BIG promise. 

So I would combine the two to write a killer sales letter \+ build a funnel. 

And simply create a Facebook Ad targeting accountants at BIG 4 companies that went something like this: 

“50% of accountants will be jobless by 2020 due to artificial intelligence, will machines (or your peers) steal YOUR job? 

Discover the all-natural nootropic accountants at \[insert BIG 4 company name\] are *secretly taking every morning* to gain an “unbeatable” edge over you…  

\<link\> 

\-

I just created this ad right now. 

It’s pretty shitty IMO. 

But you get the point. 

Any accountant fearing artificial intelligence will click on this ad. 

And buy. 

And those who don’t?

Don’t worry. 

Beauty is you’re positioning your nootropic as a way to mitigate the fear of “losing” one's job to artificial intelligence. 

Which means… 

Your nootropics name is being linked as a solution to artificial intelligence in your target audience's minds (while this trend is still young). 

And as the years go on… 

And artificial intelligence gets bigger and bigger…

And fear grows stronger and stronger… 

And the media starts reporting more and more on this upcoming trend and the risk to accountants, guess what your target audience is going to keep on being reminded of:

THE PROBLEM WHICH IS GOING TO MAKE THEM DESPERATE TO TRY YOUR SOLUTION (BECAUSE YOU POSITIONED YOURSELF BEAUTIFULLY AND YOU GOT THE JUICE TO TAKE A BULK OF THE MARKET SHARE). 

\--

That’s how you make a killing online. 

How do I know? 

Because it’s what I’ve been “ethically” doing for clients for the past 3 years. 

I’ve used this process to sell hundreds of thousands worth of products AND services. 

*It works.* 

**Activity** 

Think you’re getting the hang of everything?

Let’s put you to the test\!

**Part 3 \- Giving Birth To A Larger Than Life Marketing Message** 

**Rundown** 

![][image13]

This is the last step of my 3-part process. 

And guess what?

It’s time to write the actual copy. And take what we \*built\* in Part 1 and 2 and put it all together in this step. 

In other words: 

Once you’ve gone through this step, you’ll have a long-form sales letter that has the potential to pull in 6-7 figures on auto-pilot.  

Excited?

You should be. 

Here’s why. 

When it comes to copywriting most people go about it wrong (not their fault). 

They either wing it or swipe (steal) from another piece of copy in their industry. 

And you know what?

This never works. Ever. 

Why?

**Because no two copies are created equal.** 

The message you write depends entirely on who you’re speaking to, where they stand and how much they know (covered in Part 1). 

So if you go ahead and swipe someone else’s copy it may work for them, but chances are it won’t work for you.

Shame, isn’t it?

Yet that’s a mistake I see rookies making all the time (even seasoned pros). 

But don’t worry. 

Once you’ve gone through Part 3 you’ll be able to write copy easier than ever before.

Promise. 

And you don’t even need much experience. 

It just flat out works. 

So hit the button at the top of the page and we’ll dive right in. 

**But before we do, here’s a quick rundown of what we’ll be covering in this part:**

1\. Whether we should create a direct or indirect promotion  
2\. How to write a powerful headline that speaks to our target   
3\. What type of \*lead\* we should write (to hook our target from the jump)  
4\. How to write a compelling and powerful body (without getting writer’s block)  
5\. Building an iron-clad Flow of Logic   
6\. Bringing everything together and finalizing our long-form sales letter

**Ready to write a 6-7 figure promotion?**

Let’s do it. 

**1\. DIRECT OR INDIRECT**

First thing you have to determine is if you should use a direct or indirect approach.  

What does this mean?

**Direct \= Make it known you want to sell something to the target.** 

**Indirect \= Be discrete and hide your intentions.** 

If you’ve ever cold approached women, the equivalent to this would be direct game and indirect game. 

Direct game is when you go up to her and make your intentions known from the jump.

There is no confusion. 

Both of you know what the deal is.

And she either reciprocates your feelings.

Or tells you to buzzoff. 

This is direct game. 

Indirect game is when you go up to the girl and hide your intentions. 

Maybe you lead with a question:

“Hey can I get your opinion on xyz?” 

She doesn’t know your intentions. She’s out of the loop. 

The job of indirect game is to warm her up.

And then convert. 

Same goes for sales copy. 

You either make it known that you’re selling something. Or you go indirect and arouse their curiosity and then push for the conversion. 

**Here are examples of direct approaches:**

1\. Teeth In A Day With All-On-Four Dental Implants 

2\. If You Are A U.S. Resident, I Will Send You A Free Copy Of The Most Valuable Financial Book In America 

3\. You Can’t Buy This Secret System Unless You Swear Never To Reveal It To Anyone Else\! 

**Here are examples of indirect approaches:** 

1\. Five Hidden Dangers Of Your Morning Shower 

2\. When Mankind Landed On The Moon In 1969, We Unlocked The Key To A $3.7 Trillion Bonanza… 

3\. The 3 Most Dangerous Retirement Lies Brokers Are Telling Americans Today 

Do you see the difference? 

The direct approach makes it known they want you to buy something. And they have something to sell. 

The indirect approach?

You have no idea they’re even selling you anything. It just comes across as \*content\*.   
This is important. 

Because \*most\* marketers don’t even think about whether they should lead with a direct headline or an indirect headline. Yet this is one of the most important things you can ever consider. 

Why?

If you go direct and your target isn’t aware of your product or service, they’ll ignore your ad. And won’t bother reading. 

If you go indirect and your target already knows about your product or service, they’ll think the ad isn’t for them. And move on. 

It’s literally a make or break decision. 

So which one should you pick—direct or indirect? 

It depends. 

On what? 

The \*intelligence\* we gathered in Part 1\. 

In other words—whether you go direct or indirect is 100% contingent on your target’s level of awareness. 

**IF: They fall into any of these awareness levels:** 

* **Most aware**  
* **Product aware**   
* **Solution aware**

**THEN: You should go with a direct approach.** 

Why? 

They know you. 

They know they have a problem.

They know your solution. 

There is no point in sugar coating things. And beating around the bush. 

You need to go right for the kill—it works better. 

On the other hand…

**IF: They fit into the following levels of awareness:**

* **Clueless**   
* **Problem aware**

**THEN: You should go with an indirect approach.** 

And warm them up (before you introduce your product or service). 

Why?

They don’t know you. 

They don’t know your solution. 

They don’t even know (or understand) they have a problem. 

So you should go indirect and lead with the problem before you introduce your product or service. 

Got it?

Your turn to determine this for your own promotion. 

**(Step-By-Step Guide) Should You Create A Direct Or Indirect Promotion?** 

**Step (1) [Review your 6 Figure Promo Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eSwmUOwJ_2gBQt8sQkFntnvI_LZSXYJIkGtBdtmB9qc/edit?usp=sharing).** 

In particular you want to look at what you put down for your target’s awareness level.   
It doesn’t matter WHAT awareness level your target is in (a good marketer can make anything work). 

It’s just important to know where your target’s level of awareness lives. 

Because this determines everything we do. And everything we say (or don’t say) to our target. 

**Step (2) Pull the trigger**

Based on your target’s awareness level, you’ll know if you should create a direct promotion or an indirect promotion. 

We already covered this before. 

But here it is again for your reference:

**If your target falls into any of these awareness levels:** 

* Most aware  
* Product aware   
* Solution aware

You should go with a direct approach. 

**If your target fits into the following levels of awareness:**

* Clueless   
* Problem aware

You should go with an indirect approach. 

Got it?

Cool. 

Now it’s time to write the headline and the subheadline (and actually start bringing our direct or indirect 6-7 figure promotion to life). 

**Progress Check: At this point you should:**

* Have a target   
* Know what level of sophistication your market lives in  
* Know your targets level of awareness  
* Know your targets BIG problem  
* Created a BIG IDEA  
* Built an irresistible offer  
* Come up with a compelling USP   
* Created a BIG PROMISE  
* Created a Unique Mechanism  
* Gathered Proof  
* Determined if you should create a direct or indirect promotion 

**See It In Action:** 

Back to Susan. 

Looking at all the \*intelligence\* we gathered, we already know Susan belongs to the solution aware level. 

This means she’s being bombarded with offer after offer. 

And already knows solutions exist on the marketplace.

She just hasn’t found the right solution. *A solution proven to work.* 

So what we’re going to do is… 

Go direct and use a clever headline, one that introduces our solution (and positions our solution as brand new and exciting and more importantly proven to work). 

Again, we’re not creating the headline in this section (I’m just thinking ahead). 

All we’re doing is determining if we should create a direct or indirect promotion. 

And we know our answer:

**Solution Aware \= Direct Promotion.** 

See how simple the decision is?

We don’t even have to think about it. 

—

**Note:** Most marketers \*pitching\* to Susan would spend an obnoxious amount of time going over her problem, being indirect, and getting all warm and cozy, but that wouldn’t work. 

Why?

Susan is Solution Aware. 

She knows she has a problem. 

She doesn’t need to hear it from you.

She already understands it. 

If you go indirect and try to warm her up, she’ll automatically think you’re just like everybody else. And will ignore you. 

So that’s why we’re going to hit her with our solution right away.

And go direct.

And break her out of auto-pilot. 

(It’s the only chance we have of selling her.)

**2\. HEADLINES**

Before we create an irresistible headline that calls out your chosen target, I have a quick question for you. 

Would you rather choose: 

Killer Headline \+ Good Copy 

or 

Mediocre Headline \+ Exceptional Copy 

What would you pick? 

\[answer now then scroll below\]

If you picked B, congratulations… 

You’re wrong. 

Why? 

If your headline doesn’t attract attention, it doesn’t matter how good the rest of your copy is. It won’t get read. People are busy. You only have a few seconds to hook em. And if you miss your shot, they’re gone. 

*For good.* 

So you should literally spend 80% of your time on the headline and lead (we’ll cover the lead in the next section).  

It’s that important. 

Because the headline and lead are what determines who will read your promotion (and who’ll stop reading your promotion). 

**A good rule of thumb is:** 

If you can get your target to read the headline and your lead (while building their interest), then it’s a good chance they will continue reading your entire copy (and buy) or at the very least, *skim it*. 

That’s your job. 

And the type of headline you create all depends on what? 

A few things. 

1\. Whether you’re building a direct or indirect promotion (covered in the step prior). 

2\. Your market’s sophistication level (covered in Part 1). 

Let’s dive right in. 

**(Step-By-Step Guide) How to write killer headlines (both direct and indirect)**

Want to know something surprising?

I don’t like to think. 

I like to build systems and processes that are easily replicable (so I can scale). 

So when it comes to determining what type of headline to write, I don’t want my employees to leave it to chance, annoy me with questions, or just wing it. 

Nah. 

I want them to follow a proven approach. 

One that leads to the right answer. Every time. 

**Below is that proven approach.** 

**Step (1) Review your market’s sophistication level** 

Different headlines are required for different stages of market sophistication. 

So go back. [Review your 6 figure Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eSwmUOwJ_2gBQt8sQkFntnvI_LZSXYJIkGtBdtmB9qc/edit?usp=sharing). And remind yourself of your market’s sophistication level. 

**Step (2) Determine the appropriate headline for your market’s level of sophistication** 

Below I’ve included the exact type of headline you should write based on your market’s level of sophistication (this comes directly from the GOAT Eugene Schwartz): 

**First Stage Of Sophistication** 

“Be simple. Be direct. Above all, don’t be fancy. Name either the need or claim in your headline—nothing more. Dramatize the claim in your copy—make it as powerful as possible. And then bring in your product; and prove that it works.” 

*Example:*

“NOW\! LOSE UGLY FAT\!”

**Second Stage of Sophistication** 

“If you’re second, and the direct claim is still working—then copy that successful claim—but enlarge on it. Drive it to the absolute limit. Outbit your competition.” 

*Example:*

“LOSE UP TO 47 POUNDS IN 4 WEEKS—OR RECEIVE $40 BACK\!”

**Third Level Of Sophistication** 

“If your market is at the stage where they’ve heard all the claims, in all their extremes, then mere repetition or exaggeration won’t work any longer. What this market needs now is a new device to make all these claims become fresh and believable to making them again. In other words, A NEW MECHANISM—a new way to making the old promise work. A different process—a fresh chance—a brand new possibility of success where only disappointment has resulted before.” 

*Example:*

“I AM 61 POUNDS LIGHTER   
… NEVER A HUNGRY MINUTE.”

Read the Astonishing Experience of New York Food Expert with the *Famous Eat-and-Reduce Plan.* 

**Fourth Level Of Sophistication** 

“If a competitor has just introduced a new mechanism to achieve the same claim as that performed by your product, and that new-mechanism announcement is producing sales, then counter in this way. Simply elaborate or enlarge upon the successful mechanism. Make it easier, quicker, surer; allow it to solve more of the problem; overcome old limitations; promise extra benefits. You are beginning a stage of embellishment similar to the Second Stage of Sophistication.” 

*Example:*

“Nine Out Of Ten Doctors Prefer Luckies\!” 

**Fifth Stage of Sophistication** 

“Emphasis shifts from the promise and the mechanism which accomplishes it, to identification with the prospect himself. You are dealing here with the problem of bringing your prospect into your ad—not through desire—but through identification.”

**Step (3) Use the proven formulas below to write your headline/subheadline (and try to include your BIG IDEA, PROMISE, USP inside your headline/subheadline)**

If you’re creating a direct promotion, use a direct headline. 

If you’re creating an indirect promotion, use an indirect headline. 

Here are some of my favorite formulas (they’re proven and tested). 

**Direct Headline Formulas:** 

“I Will Teach You \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ That Will Guarantee\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_… And… I’ll Prove It To You FREE\!”

**Headline Swipe File:**

Here is the best headline swipe file I’ve ever found\! 

Use this for inspiration. 

I recommend opening this when you’re brainstorming angles and headlines for your promotion. 

\[insert headline swipe file\] 

**Progress Check: At this point you should:**

* Have a target   
* Know what level of sophistication your market lives in  
* Know your targets level of awareness  
* Know your targets BIG problem  
* Created a BIG IDEA  
* Built an irresistible offer  
* Come up with a compelling USP   
* Created a BIG PROMISE  
* Created a Unique Mechanism  
* Gathered Proof  
* Determined if you should create a direct or indirect promotion   
* Created your headline/subheadline

**See It In Action:** 

(Back to Susan and the 6 figure promotion we’re building inside this course.) 

We know we’re going to lead with a direct headline. 

And we know our market sophistication level \= 3\. 

**This means our headline/subheadline has to:**

1\) Lead with our solution.   
2\) Introduce our unique mechanism—because otherwise our target will dismiss our copy. And think we’re just another company making claims that aren’t proven. And won’t work. 

Based on the above, I just have to create a simple solution oriented headline with a mechanism (mentioned in the subheadline). 

**Here’s the headline I’m going with:** 

WEAR THIS ST VALENTINE’S MEDAL DAILY 

AND LET ME KNOW HOW QUICKLY THE “MIRACULOUS SOIL” INSIDE RELEASES ST VALENTINE’S LOVE ENERGIES UNTO YOU AND FULFILLS ALL YOUR LOVE RELATED DESIRES\!

**A few points to note:** 

* This direct headline makes it known we’re selling something (because Susan is in the solution aware level)  
* This headline introduces our unique mechanism (medal contains “miraculous soil” inside)  
* This headline introduces our BIG IDEA (St. Valentine’s Love Energies)   
* This headline introduces our USP (St. Valentines Medal)   
* This headline clearly articulates our BIG promise (fulfill all your love related desires)   
* This headline hints at our proof (let me know how quickly it works for you)

See how I just took everything we built in part 2 and put it inside the headline?

That’s all we have to do. 

Now we just have to do this for the rest of our copy. 

Starting with our lead. 

Then the body. 

And answer all our targets objections.

(All very easy to do.) 

And we’ll be able to pull in 6-7 figures with this promotion. 

**3\. Lead**

It’s time to write the lead. 

What do I mean by the “lead”?

The lead is the first few paragraphs of your copy (the hook). 

The lead just like the headline is very important because people will read your opening paragraphs and if your lead don’t keep them reading, *you’re toast.* 

You have to hook em. Engage em. Hit em where it hurts. 

How do you do this?

Again it depends on the questions we asked in Part 1 (that’s why we do things in the order we do em in. Like I said, do the upfront work in Part 1 and marketing is easy). 

But this time we’re concerned with our target’s level of awareness. 

Why?

**Because we have to write to our target based on much he or she already knows.** 

So many times, I see \*marketers\* writing to a target that has NO IDEA they even have a problem and yet the copy is trying to sell them on a solution they don’t even care about because the copy failed to make them care. 

On the other hand, I also see \*marketers\* writing about the problem for way too long when the reader already understands their problem and just wants to hear the solution. 

Up till now… 

You probably just winged your lead. Talked about the problem. Talked about the solution. Or whatever came to mind. 

Because you didn’t know any better. 

But you gon’ learn today \*Kevin Hart voice\*. 

In the next section, we’re going to discuss what type of lead you should write based on what level of awareness your target lives in. 

(Again, I want you to notice how everything is calculated here. We don’t leave anything to chance. If you want to craft 6-7 figure promotions, you shouldn’t just open your laptop and start writing (not at first at least). You should be systematic. And be prepared. And write accordingly.) 

**(Step-By-Step Guide) How To Come Up With Irresistible Leads:**

**Step (1) Pair your target’s awareness level with the appropriate lead**

Below are the types of leads you should create (based on your target’s level of awareness).

**Level 1 \- Clueless Target**

Use an indirect lead. 

Don’t mention your product or service. 

Don’t mention the problem. 

First arouse curiosity. Then slowly, but surely transition into the problem, potential solutions, and introduce your company. 

*Example:* 

![][image14]

**Level 2 \- Problem Aware Target**

These people are aware of their problem, but may not know everything they need to know about it. 

So begin with the problem and educate them. 

The job of your lead is to show your target that you empathize with their circumstances and understand their problem (\*you were just like them\*). 

*Example:* 

![][image15]

**Level 3 \- Solution Aware Target**

These people know of potential solutions. 

But they don’t know about your solution. 

So begin with your BIG IDEA and transition into your solution (using your unique mechanism). 

Your job here is to build rapport and trust (and prove that your solution will actually do what you say because of your \*unique mechanism\*). 

Example: 

![][image16]

**Level 4 \- Product Aware Target** 

These people know about your product. 

So the job of your lead is to simply reassure your target (that your product is the right choice for them). 

Do this by leading with testimonials, proof or your credibility. 

Example: 

![][image17]

**Level 5 \- Most Aware Target**

These people are the easiest to convert. 

No need to mention the problem. 

No need to talk about potential solutions. 

All your lead has to do is:

(1) introduce your offer  
(2) give a strong reason to buy  
(3) make it super easy 

That’s it. 

Example: 

![][image18]

**Progress Check: At this point you should:**

* Have a target   
* Know what level of sophistication your market lives in  
* Know your targets level of awareness  
* Know your targets BIG problem  
* Created a BIG IDEA  
* Built an irresistible offer  
* Come up with a compelling USP   
* Created a BIG PROMISE  
* Created a Unique Mechanism  
* Gathered Proof  
* Determined if you should create a direct or indirect promotion   
* Created your headline/subheadline  
* Have written your lead

**See It In Action:** 

(Back to Susan and the 6 figure promotion we’re building inside this course.)

Susan is in the solution aware level, so like we just said our lead has to:

Begin with our BIG IDEA and transition into our solution (using our unique mechanism). Our job here is to build rapport and trust (and prove that our solution will actually do what we say it will because of our \*unique mechanism\*). 

Based on that, here’s the lead I’ve created (based on my BIG IDEA): 

“St Valentine is considered one of the great forces of the world. 

At the Whitefriar Street Carmelite Church, which holds the relics of St Valentine, **lost loves have been reunited, new love has been found, and lifelong relationships have been created.** 

Thousands of people in search of love visit this church in Dublin, Ireland each year to receive “love energies” from St Valentine. 

The question is, do these people get to fulfill all their love related desires? **The answer could very well be yes.** 

It’s a simple lead with a compelling hook. 

And it gets Susan’s attention, fuels her desire and keeps her reading. 

(Exactly what a good lead is supposed to do.)

**4\. The Body \- Building The Framework** 

Before we get cracking on the body, let’s do another quick recap: 

* We know who we’re speaking to (our target)  
* Where our market stands  
* How much our target knows

And we also have our:

* PROBLEM  
* BIG IDEA  
* IRRESISTIBLE OFFER   
* USP  
* BIG PROMISE  
* UNIQUE MECHANISM   
* PROOF 

Plus, we’ve just now determined:

* Whether to go indirect or direct  
* Our headline  
* Lead 

Now it’s time to write the body of the copy (and build out a super simple framework anybody can use to write high converting copy). 

How do you do it?

Should you just write whatever comes to mind?

Nah. *Not at all.* 

That’s way too difficult. And not proven or systematic. At all.

Plus it’s unnecessary. 

Because it’s actually much easier to write high-converting copy. 

Without having to face the torture of trying to fill up an empty page.  

And I’m going to teach you it. Now. 

**(Step-By-Step Guide) How To Write The Body Of Your Copy** 

**Step (1) Brainstorm all potential objections your product or service can raise in your target’s mind. Every single objection you can think about—write it down.** 

These objections will depend on what you’re selling. 

But some objections will always exist—regardless of what you’re selling. 

*Here are some of those:*

* How do I know this works?  
* What is this?  
* What makes you different?  
* This sounds like bullshit.  
* It’s too expensive.   
* Is this a scam?   
* If it’s as good as you say it is—why is the price so low?  
* Who are you?  
* How much does it cost?  
* Why should I believe/trust you?  
* Is there a money back guarantee?  
* Do you have any proof to back up your claims? 

Keep going. 

Keep the list flowing. 

And jot down every objection that comes to mind. 

**Step (2) Rank those objections in the order they occur in your target’s mind.** 

Have you ever read a sales letter and the copy answered your question at the exact moment it crossed your mind? 

That’s not a coincidence, bro. 

Every great copywriter knows how to do that. 

And if you follow this step, you’ll be able to do it as well. 

So go ahead and rank all the objections you brainstormed in step 1 in the order they naturally occur in your target’s mind.  

*For instance:* 

“Why should I care?” would be somewhere near the top of the list. 

“How much does it cost?” would come later on. 

“Is there a guarantee?” would come after “how much does it cost?” 

Create a general order of how and when these objections would hit your target’s mind. 

And write this order down. 

Once done proceed to the next step. 

**Step (3) Turn the objections into selling points** 

Take your objection and turn it into a selling point that answers the objection. 

For instance: 

“Why should I trust you?” could be turned into “Trusted by 10200 real estate brokers in Vancouver, British Columbia”. 

Do you see how the selling point automatically answers the objection without ever bringing it up consciously? 

Good. 

Do this for every objection you have (and use your selling points to communicate your BIG IDEA, BIG PROMISE, UNIQUE MECHANISM etc.). 

Turn each objection into a selling-point, one that addresses the objection in a powerful and compelling way. 

At the end of this exercise, you should have a list of selling points (that flow in a logical order). 

And now it’s time to turn those selling points into an iron-clad flow of logic (then all you have to do is write short paragraphs in between each selling point and the job of those few paragraphs is to address the objection. That’s all. And your body is done\!) 

**Progress Check: At this point you should:**

* Have a target   
* Know what level of sophistication your market lives in  
* Know your targets level of awareness  
* Know your targets BIG problem  
* Created a BIG IDEA  
* Built an irresistible offer  
* Come up with a compelling USP   
* Created a BIG PROMISE  
* Created a Unique Mechanism  
* Gathered Proof  
* Determined if you should create a direct or indirect promotion   
* Created your headline/subheadline  
* Wrote your lead  
* Have a list of selling points (for your body)

**6\. Bringing It To Life** 

Before we get inside our promo, let’s do a quick review. 

I promised you wouldn’t have to do much copywriting to create a 6-7 figure promotion. 

And you know what?

I was right. 

Because here’s the thing: 

We’ve pretty much built out the entire structure of our copy following a step-by-step process, one anybody can follow. And everything was broken down into easy to digest steps, so all you had to do was follow along and create. 

Truthfully, you didn’t even have to think that much. 

And that’s good. 

Because it means the process is replicable. 

You basically do upfront research and let the answers to your questions determine the exact type of copy you should create (and you take the guesswork right out of it). 

That’s exactly what we’ve done. 

Now all we have to do is dig inside our Flow of Logic and write a few sentences in between each of our selling points. 

If you’re new to copywriting, you may think this is difficult.   
But it’s really not. 

Because you’ll know exactly what to write. 

And when.

And where.

No guesswork. 

I promise. 

**(Step-By-Step Guide) How To Bring Your Copy To Life**: 

**Step (1) Open up your Flow of Logic**

Take the flow of logic we just built and open it up before you. 

You’ll realize you have the headline done. Subheadline done. The lead done. 

And you also have a bunch of selling points for your body. 

All you’re missing is text in between each selling point.

**Step (2) Fill in the missing details**

How?

Easy. 

Simply take your selling points and elaborate. 

For instance if my selling point was: 

*“St Valentine creates wonderful miracles of love.”*

I would talk about the miracles of love he creates. 

Then move on to the next selling point.   
And fill in information about that.

And so on and so forth.

I don’t have to guess what to write. Or how. I just elaborate on each selling point and my copy flows nicely and gets the job done with ease. 

**Step (3) Edit**   

Once you do the above, you’re all done\! 

Or almost done. 

Just run a final edit and ask yourself:

* Is the BIG idea easily conveyed?   
* Our objections addressed?   
* Does the copy flow logically and sequentially?   
* Is the offer irresistible? (BIG promise)  
* Is it easier to say YES than NO? 

If yes, LAUNCH (you’ve got a winner).  

That’s all there is to it.  

Nothing complicated. Nothing confusing. 

Straightforward. 

Proven.

Tested. 

Very methodological. 

Now let’s see how we can apply this. 

**Progress Check: At this point you should:**

* Have a target   
* Know what level of sophistication your market lives in  
* Know your targets level of awareness

Reports of these miracles have ranged from people getting their ex back, old love being rekindled, and the emergence of new relationships and marriages that last a lifetime. 

That is why, you see, the love energies of St Valentine could be responsible for the most powerful, astonishing love miracles recorded in all of history. 

**Now Here Is The Wonderful News**

I have reserved for you the authentic St Valentine Medal which contains precious soil from St Valentine’s shrine in Dublin, Ireland.

After all, this St Valentine medal captures a beautiful image of St Valentine with a special prayer that reads, “Grant me love.” And is considered to be one of the most gorgeous love charms on the planet. 

**But this St Valentine Medal is much more than just a beautiful medal \- IT WILL ALSO RELEASE ST VALENTINE’S LOVE ENERGIES UNTO YOU.**

The St Valentine’s Medal will deliver love energies into your world because it captures and spreads the all powerful presence of St Valentine to whomever beholds it. 

**The Story of St Valentine’s Power To Create Miracles Of Love Goes Back To The Ancient World**

Throughout the ancient world, individuals from all walks of life sought out St Valentine because he possessed the rare gift of creating loving relationships and restoring joy and wellness. The miracles created by St Valentine have been well-documented. 

* We know that in Rome, St Valentine restored the sight and hearing of the daughter of a judge who was suffering from blindness. 

* We know that St Valentine used his powers to free all Christian inmates who were wrongfully imprisoned. 

* We know that St Valentine created marriages that lasted a lifetime. 

* We know that he stood up for love and secretly married Christian couples, and helped keep love in their hearts while they were being persecuted by the Roman Emperor, Claudius. 

* We know that he paired together young men and women who fell in love, and blessed the ancient world with feelings of love and passion they had never known before. 

* And we also know that his powers were so vast and superior that Judge Asterius, Roman emperors, and kings visited St Valentine many times, while searching and longing for a life full of everlasting love. 

But as wonderful as these miracles were, they pale in comparison to the unlimited miracles of love St Valentine continues to create to this day\! 

That’s because after he suffered martyrdom on the 14th day of February, his name became synonymous with love itself and now on every Valentines Day messages of affection, love and devotion are exchanged around the world to symbolize and call upon the loving energies of St Valentine.

**More importantly, however, wishes for love are also expressed and granted because St Valentine hasn’t stopped delivering miracles of love\!** 

That’s right, my friend. 

Today the shrine of St Valentine, alongside a statue of the Saint are housed by the Whitefriar Church, together with a small vessel tinged with his blood… 

… and these relics carry with them the energy to revolutionize your love life\! 

**St Valentine Rated Tops**   
**In Fulfilling Desires For Love** 

Thousands of individuals, from all backgrounds, races, and ethnicities have visited St Valentine’s shrine in Dublin, Ireland and have reported *thousands* of miracles of love, which have been confirmed by even the toughest of skeptics. 

And what’s more is many of these miracles were experienced by individuals who had almost given up on the pursuit of love altogether. People who had been cheated on, betrayed, and carried around a heart full of pain and lived a life of loneliness.

Just look at some of the miracles of love that happened to people who were in the presence of St Valentine’s shrine: 

* **One female visitor,** from a small town outside Dublin, Ireland, was miraculously granted her wish for love. She visited the church earlier this year and said *“God has someone in mind for me, and I obviously haven’t met him yet. So I just hope that Saint Valentine will assist me, that I will find him.”* A few months later she met a tall and handsome man who she fell head over heels in love with and later happily married. 

* **A single man** was tired of living a life without love. He had tried literally everything out there, and still failed miserably in the romantic department. As a result, he set out to visit St Valentine’s Shrine and expressed his prayer for love while stating to local reporters, *“I’ve tried everything, speed dating, online, the whole lot, maybe a prayer to St. Valentine might help.”* Shortly thereafter, he met a woman on a hiking trip who he quickly fell for and now has been dating for 3 years, with plans of proposing soon. 

* **A couple** who travelled far and wide to visit St Valentine’s Shrine recently came back to pay homage because they had met at the site four years ago and were now planning their marriage. *“This is our perfect place,”* said the woman, while her husband-to-be looked on with eyes full of affection. 

* **A group of single women in their 30’s** made the trip out to the Whitefriar Church, stating *“We just prayed to find the right one, and we believe we will be led to him when the time is right.”* St Valentine quickly created the right time and now these fortunate women are all in happy, healthy, and joyful relationships. 

* **A middle aged divorcee** visited St Valentine’s Shrine with her new fiance nearly two decades ago. She asked St Valentine to look after their relationship and to always fill it with laughter, joy, and love. Today, the woman is 73 years old and her marriage is as strong as ever and continues to get better with each passing day. 

* **Another woman,** experienced St Valentine’s powers almost instantly after expressing her prayer for reconciliation. She stated, “*Dear St Valentine, can you please make sure that my husband and I stop fighting and we start loving one another again.”* The next morning, her usually “stubborn” husband apologized for all the wrong he had created, and set out to love her like she had never been loved before. 

* *Any many more miracles of love\!*  

As you can see, St Valentine has the power to unleash an “energy of love” which helps individuals who are deeply craving love in all aspects of their life fulfill their desires. 

Whenever these people pray in the presence of St Valentine, miracles of love occur\!

**Analysis:**

* Notice how I’m selling the BIG IDEA in the promo—not the medal.   
* Notice the flow and how I’m just elaborating on the selling points (step-by-step)  
* Notice how we bring up the unique mechanism to sell the medal (and create a market category of our own)

My client launched this exact promotion that I just built (using this 3-step process) to our target Susan and it brought in low six figures in profit. 

And continues to perform well.  

And truthfully?

That’s not a surprise. 

Because it’s expected. 

This is what I do. 

I follow these steps all day. Every day.

And \*invent\* BIG IDEAS from thin air. 

And follow the steps to execute.

And once I do, I simply put the long-form sales letter in front of my target. And make $s.

There’s nothing complicated. 

Or hard.

Or difficult about it. 

All you need to make this work is: 

LONG FORM SALES LETTER (what we just built here)

\+

TRAFFIC (Fb Ads/Google/IG whatever) 

And you make the BIG $’s. 

(We personally built out funnels and present our offers sequentially, but you don’t have to do that. It’s more complicated. You can just create these 6 figure promos. And put them in front of the right people. And make bank.)

Ready to learn how? 

In the concluding section of this course, I’ll dive into the next steps. 

And give you a quick summary.

And how you can apply this 3-step process to your biz model. 

(Then we’ll get into the bonus section where I’ll show you 2 other promotions I created that pulled in 6 figures following this 3-step process. One promotion was for a client. The other promotion was for myself.)

**Conclusion \- Actionable Next Steps**

**Summary** 

You now know everything you need to invent 6-7 figure marketing promotions… 

And you’ve seen me walk you through the entire process, step-by-step with a real live marketing promotion that I built from the ground up. 

So what do you think? 

Do you see how easy the process is?

Do you see how systematic it is?

How calculated it is? 

I hope so. 

Because when I first entered the copy world, I used to be so confused. 

I would rip off other sales letters in my niche. And they never converted. They never took me anywhere besides the town where failure lives. 

And I didn’t like that. 

So I kept digging. And it wasn’t until I was introduced to this framework that everything clicked. And I think it’ll click for you too. 

Sure you can read copywriting book after copywriting book… 

And you should. 

But those books will only teach you how to write copy--rarely do they teach you how to think and execute your entire campaign from scratch. And how to “invent” very lucrative promotions from nothing. 

I hope this course taught you that. 

I hope you realized copy and marketing success isn’t a fluke. 

A coincidence. 

Or a benefactor of luck. 

Nah.

Sure, luck plays a role. 

But if you follow the 3 steps above, you’ll be able to make cake. 

And the better you are at: 

* Empathizing with your target... 

* Coming up with BIG IDEAS and UNIQUE MECHANISMS...   
    
* And bringing everything to life… 

The more cake ($$$’s) you’ll make.   
And the more people you’ll help. 

Period. 

So focus on that. And you’ll prosper.

How exactly? 

I’ll give you some practical steps in the next section. 

Whether you have a marketing agency, personal brand or a dropshipping store--you’ll learn how to apply this process to your unique lane. 

**Practical Next Steps (Application)** 

**How To Apply:** 

Now that you know how to write a compelling and irresistible sales letter that has the potential to pull in 6-7 figures, the question becomes how do you use this 3-part process for your specific business model? 

I mean, how does this apply to marketing agencies, drop shipping businesses, affiliate marketing and the rest? 

Very good questions. 

Here’s how (and here’s what you should do to apply this): 

**Marketing Agency:** 

**Step (1)** Follow the 3-step process above to create a compelling sales letter that pitches your marketing services. 

**Step (2)** Create a short case study full of proof (ideally you want to include proof of how you’ve helped another business in your TARGET’S industry achieve the PROMISE the target wants to experience). 

**Step (3)** Use this short case study as your lead magnet.   
**Step (4)** Use the customer avatar sheet you built in Part 1 to reach your target via FB Ads. 

**Step (5)** Make the ad about the FREE case study. Tell em to click through to download it. 

**Step (6)** Once your target downloads your case study, they will be taken to a thank you page.

**Step (7)** On the thank you page, you want to show em the 6 figure sales letter you wrote (using this 3-step process) and end it with a Call To Action (CTA) that asks your target to book a FREE discovery call. 

**Step (8)** If you followed all the steps above, your target will enter in their details, get on the phone with you, and then you can close em. And sell em on a $2500/monthly package (recurring). 

**Step (9)** Close 4 clients (easily doable) and you’ll hit 6 figures a year. 

**Dropshipping** 

**Step (1)** Use this 3-step process to create a pre-sell page for your most popular dropshipping product. Make this page look like content (not a sales pitch). End with a CTA that sends your target to your product page. 

**Step (2)** Jump on FB and use the Customer Avatar we built in part 1 to reach your target.

**Step (3)** Direct FB traffic to your pre-sell page (by directing traffic to \*content\* instead of a \*product page \* your cost is usually lower).

**Step (4)** Let your target consume your pre-sell page (that you wrote following this 3-step process) and as soon as they do they’ll follow your CTA and hit up your product page and buy your dropshipping product. 

Works like a mothafuckin’ charm (this exact framework also works for affiliate marketing BTW).  

**Info-Bizness** 

**Step (1)** Follow this 3-step process to write a killer sales letter for an info product. 

**Step (2)** Create a valuable lead magnet. 

**Step (3)** Give this valuable lead magnet away via FB to your target.

**Step (4)** On the TY Page show em this sales letter

**Step (5)** Count your $

**Personal Branding** 

Make sure your personal brand has a BIG IDEA, solves a PROBLEM, has a Unique Selling Point, Unique Mechanism and PROOF. The more easily recognizable these things are, the FASTER YOU’LL BLOW UP. 

Here’s mine (for my personal brand): 

**PROBLEM:** People living in a rut, sick of their normal existence.   
**BIG IDEA:** Top of the world or bottom of the ocean.  
**OFFER:** Tweets/blog posts/emails.   
**PROMISE:** Follow along and let’s hit the top of the world together (get $$$/power).  
**USP:** Comediz Bizman (entertainment \+ practical content)  
**UNIQUE MECHANISM:** My unique experiences (dig agency/offline bizness/stories)  
**PROOF:** Twitter Threads: (1) How I Turned $1000 Into \~$89000. (2) How I Built 2 Six Figure Businesses By 24\. (3) How I Made $500-$1000 In A Weekend.

Get it?

See how easily transferable this process is to everything?

Good shit. 

That’s about it. 

Hope you enjoyed this course. 

If you dug it, shoot me a tweet or email and let me know (would mean the world to me). 

Now before you go, I also promised you some killer bonuses.

“In Just One Morning, You Can Awaken The Intellectual Powers Of Your Performer Enneatype… 

**AND GAIN MORE FOCUS, IMPROVE YOUR**   
**MEMORY… PLUS ELIMINATE MENTAL CLUTTER\!** 

Dear Reader, 

The Performer Enneatype is the smartest, resourceful, and driven of the 9 Enneatypes, yet very few people in this world recognize the *unfair* advantage it gives you. 

It has been secretly labelled the *“Achiever”* for decades \- because those who possess this all powerful Enneatype \- quickly rise to high levels of wealth and abundance… 

… and receive godly amounts of admiration for their intelligence and ability to achieve great things. 

{\!FIRSTNAME\_FIX}, IT IS MY PROFESSIONAL OBLIGATION TO TELL YOU THAT SUCCESS AND ABUNDANCE COULD BE YOURS ONCE YOU AWAKEN THE INTELLECTUAL POWERS OF YOUR PERFORMER ENNEATYPE. 

After all, one of the professor’s who created the Enneatype once told his students: 

**“BEING A PERFORMER IS AS GOOD AS WINNING THE LOTTERY (IF NOT BETTER) BECAUSE  YOU HAVE THE INNATE POWER TO ACHIEVE ABUNDANCE IN EVERY AREA OF YOUR LIFE.”** 

According to his highly respected framework, Performers are the self-assured, attractive, and charming types \- who quickly achieve growth in all areas of their life, and attract money and success in droves. 

More importantly, however, their high levels of ambition, competence and energy turns them into the “stars” of human nature because they are often both very successful and well liked.

**Thus it should come as no surprise to discover that the most successful and respected people to ever grace this earth, from Bill Clinton to Michael Jordan to Bill Gates belong to the Performer Enneatype.** 

That’s no coincidence, {\!firstname\_fix}. 

Although this level of fame and wealth is *unattainable* for most of the world, it is very much possible for Performers because they have the “intellectual powers” to effortlessly draw success, prosperity, and wealth into their life\! 

So if you’re fortunate enough to belong to the Performer Enneatype, but you haven’t yet experienced the level of abundance you seek, keep reading because it’s very likely that… 

**You Are Only Living Up To A Small**   
**Fraction Of The Powers Of The Performer**

{\!firstname\_fix}, it’s been well documented that Performer’s have the innate ability to turns dreams into reality, ideas into money, and relationships into lifelong bonds\! It’s their secret power, a gift from the universe.

But if this gift isn’t opened, you don’t get to reap the benefits. 

So {\!firstname\_fix} \-

* *If you’re currently desiring financial independence, yet you can’t come up with any good ideas…and you’re scratching for every nickel and dime…*


* *If the years seem to be moving faster and faster, yet you remain in the same unfulfilled position… with dreams that keep moving further and further away…* 

* *If you know there is much more for you to be, do, and have, yet you don’t know how to get started… or how to keep your enthusiasm alive once you do begin…* 

* *If you yearn for a life of complete ease and abundance, yet you find yourself constantly tired and unmotivated… and “mentally out of it”...* 

Then it is my professional opinion to inform you that you are only living up to a small fraction of the powers of the Performer… 

**… and you have yet to experience your FULL gift.** 

Forgive me for being rather blunt, but that’s just the truth.

And you know it to be too, don’t you {\!firstname\_fix}? 

That deep sense of knowing there is so MUCH MORE of your potential to be brought to the light… 

So much more adventures to experience… 

So much more of your potential to fulfill… 

So many more memories to create… 

And so much more success to capture.

This isn’t just a deep sense of knowing, {\!firstname\_fix}. 

**It’s your inner Performer Enneatype attempting to move you towards a greater, richer, and more fulfilling path.** 

And that’s because…

The Performer is capable of achieving so much more than what you’re currently letting into your life.

**Take Oprah Winfrey For Example: She Is The Ideal Performer And A True Indicator Of**   
**What Is Possible For Performers…** 

Oprah Winfrey, America’s first lady of talk shows, has amassed a fortune and earned fame and respect from the entire world \- making her one of the richest and most successful Performers to ever live. 

Yet she didn’t always lead a life blessed with good fortune and ease… 

In fact, Oprah had one of the most difficult childhoods.

As you may already know, she was impoverished, beaten, abused, and even raped… *over and over again.* 

**So what was the turning point, the one that transformed Oprah from a broken, impoverished girl into one of the most successful woman to ever walk the earth?**

Oprah’s father. 

She credits him for awakening something inside her, something deep down inside, which brought her potential to the light and inspired her to be all that she could be. 

Here is Oprah reciting the tale in her own words \- 

*“My father was very strict and provided me with guidance, structure, rules, and books. He required me to complete weekly book reports, and I went without dinner until I learned five new vocabulary words each day. Shortly thereafter, I became an excellent student, participated well in the drama club, debate club, and student council. It was the turning point, something was awakened inside me and I was born anew from that day forward.”*

In other words, {\!firstname\_fix}...  

**Oprah’s father helped awaken in her the “intellectual powers” of her Performer Enneatype that she didn’t even know existed\!** 

And it was these intellectual powers that contributed to Oprah’s rise and success.

Without this awakening, Oprah may have continued drifting in and out of turmoil… and would have lived and died without ever blossoming into the person she was destined to become\! 

**Now, as great as that is for Oprah, it could be unfortunate news for you and many other Performers.** 

And that’s because \- 

I get the sense from you that you’re in a very similar state of mind as Oprah was as a young woman. Wouldn’t you agree, {\!firstname\_fix}?

*You have unused talents inside you.* 

*You have untapped potential flowing through you.* 

*You have unexploited strengths deep in you.* 

**But You Aren’t Living Up To Your Full Potential Because You Haven’t Awakened These “Intellectual Powers” Of Your Enneatype…** 

And so \- 

You find yourself yearning for more, but failing in your pursuits because you haven’t yet awakened the intellectual powers required to bring these dreams to fruition. 

Instead of unlocking your hidden powers and becoming the highly intelligent, productive, and driven Performer you have the potential to be, you have lived a life characterized with the complete opposite… 

*Brain fog…* 

*Lack of focus…* 

*Low energy…* 

*Inability to think critically…* 

*Low creativity…* 

*Ineffective problem solving skills…*

Have all plagued your life.

**Making it all-the-more difficult for you to awaken your Performer’s intellectual powers.** 

Is it thus any surprise why you haven’t yet achieved what you set out to accomplish, why you don’t have the amount of money you seek, why your relationships aren’t as strong as they could be, why your heart bleeds the blood of misery and ill-fortune? 

With all due respect, it’s not surprising to me, {\!firstname\_fix}\! 

And that’s because I’ve seen many Performers of your kind (in fact… I was one of them)...

Performers destined to achieve great things, Performers destined to inspire the world, Performers destined to take care of themselves and their family… but failing to do so because they did not take advantage of the unique intellectual powers they were blessed with… 

Unfortunate, isn’t it? 

Fortunately, my dear friend, this doesn’t have to stay your reality. 

And that’s because \-

**You Can Quickly Reverse These Effects And Activate The Intellectual Powers Of Your Performer Enneatype (Powers That You Can’t Access Yet)... If  You Carefully Listen To What I’m About To Tell You…**

{\!firstname\_fix}, awakening the hidden powers of your Performer Enneatype will truly be the deciding factor between whether you capture the abundance you are entitled to or if you continue feeling the emotions of failure and misery. 

I know this to be true because it’s the ONE THING that has made the MOST difference in my own life and the lives of thousands of my students. 

It is therefore my professional duty to help you activate your Enneatype’s hidden powers instead of keeping them locked inside you where they do not serve you, because the truth is… 

MOST PERFORMERS NEVER DO AWAKEN THEIR INTELLECTUAL POWERS\! 

They go through life without ever filling their world with the high levels of success and abundance they were destined to reach. 

I don’t want you to suffer the same fate. Instead, I want to hold you by the hand today and introduce you to the \#1 resource myself and countless other Performers have used to naturally and effectively awaken our intellectual powers… *in just a matter of hours\!* 

**Introducing: Brain Fortius Brain Supplement** 

Now before you go ahead and dismiss this as just another supplement, I must warn you that you’d be doing a huge disservice to yourself (as you’re about to realize… so keep reading). 

And that’s because this isn’t your ordinary supplement. 

No, my dear friend\!

**Brain Fortius is one of the fastest acting supplements and is scientifically proven to increase your focus, memory, and energy while improving your clarity of thoughts.** 

And best of all, it’s the fastest (and safest way) to bring you closer to fully realizing your Performer’s intellectual powers\! 

Of course, I don’t expect you to believe me now (and you shouldn’t), but soon you will because…  

I’m living proof that Brain Fortius works, and it works fast\! 

That’s right, {\!firstname\_fix}. 

Brain Fortius is the ONLY supplement that has ever helped awaken in me powers I didn’t even know I possessed.

*Everything from raw untapped potential to new ideas worth millions to better ways to serve and guide people like you.*  

And all these powers were made available to me in less than 12 hours after taking Brain Fortius\! 

That’s not a fluke either, {\!firstname\_fix}. 

I’ve since then gave countless of my Performer students the very same Brain Fortius supplement and they too have gone on to lead a life of success and abundance… shortly after the supplement helped activate mental powers in them they never knew they had\! 

Now, of course, this may all seem too much for you to take in at once. 

And I get it.

But it’s really not as bizarre as it sounds. 

**And that’s because Brain Fortius is carefully engineered to safely and effectively allow you to access superior levels of mind (powers you currently can’t access)… in the least amount of time...** 

So unlike any other supplement, you feel the effects right away and become the strongest version of your Performer Enneatype instantly\! 

To illustrate how and why this is possible, let’s take a deeper look into the ingredients of Brain Fortius. 

**Here Are The Ingredients**   
**That Make Up Brain Fortius …**  

{\!firstname\_fix}, the reason why Brain Fortius is so effective is because it is composed of two classes of ingredients. 

The first group, *Group A*, consists of natural fast working ingredients that are proven to help you awaken your intellectual powers as quickly as the next morning. The other group, *Group B*, is made up of ingredients that don’t work nearly as fast, but provide life transforming abilities in the long run. 

Let’s discuss each in greater detail \-

**Group A: Natural Fast Working Ingredients** 

**Vitamin B3 (Niacin) \-** Niacin, better known as vitamin B3, is one of the most important nutrients for your health and well-being. It works by helping enzymes convert food into energy, while simultaneously boosting your brain's performance. 

Without it, your brain cannot perform at superior levels. So if you find yourself suffering from brain fog or fatigue, you may have a Niacin deficiency. Fortunately, Brain Fortius delivers healthy levels of Niacin into your bloodstream, which begins to produce a warming effect in you as quickly as the next morning, giving you a boost in brain function and energy. 

**Ginkgo Biloba Extract 24% Flavone Glycosidee \-** Ginkgo Biloba is another fast-working and effective ingredient of Brain Fortius. Why? Because it comes from the world’s oldest living species of tree. That’s right, {\!firstname\_fix}. Ginkgo is a very unique ingredient, often used in modern herbal medicine because it’s scientifically proven to increase memory while boosting mental alertness. 

What’s more is with Brain Fortius, you are guaranteed to enjoy the full benefits of this all-powerful ingredient in just minutes because the supplement is standardized to 24% glycosides for increased potency. 

**Rhodiola P.E. 3% Rosavins \-** The next ingredient of Group A, is a traditional Chinese medicine and Scandinavian herb which is used to increase both physical and cognitive vitality. According to leading scientists, Rhodiola appears to reduce fatigue and exhaustion. Better still, new studies are also finding a strong link between Rhodiola and longevity. One study in particular found a 20% increase in lifespan for those who took Rhodiola via supplements. 

**Alpha GPC \-** Alpha-Glycerophosphocholine is a cholinergic compound used to boost cognitive performance and increase physical power (*that’s right… this one ingredient actually makes you mentally and physically STRONGER\!*). 

It also appears to support cellular membranes and may help prevent cognitive decline, which means you can hold onto your Performer’s intellectual powers well into old age. It works by promoting a chemical in the brain called, acetylcholine, which is responsible for memory and learning.

**Dimethylethanolamine \-** Dimethylethanolamine is a neurological stimulant, which is typically available in the brain in very small amounts. Once you provide the brain with greater levels, however, scientists have discovered that your mood increases, memory improves, energy goes through the roof, and you reach higher levels of intelligence. *Levels you didn’t even know existed\!* 

It works by helping your brain increase the speed in which it synthesizes the neurotransmitter, acetylcholine, which plays a vital role in accessing higher levels of mental ability. 

**Huperzine A \-** Huperzine A also increases levels of the very powerful brain chemical acetylcholine, which is one of the chemicals our nerves use to communicate with the brain, muscles, and other areas. Once you ingest Huperzine A, **it appears in the bloodstream just 15 minutes after and instantly increases your memory and mental performance.** 

**Bioperine \-** Bioperine is a special type of extract from black pepper, which helps increase absorption of very important nutrients such as vitamin C, selenium, beta-carotene, vitamin A, vitamin B-6 and coenzyme Q. This is important because when you increase the absorption of these nutrients, you help your body extract maximum benefits from each. 

That’s why Bioperine has been strongly linked with helping inhibit tumors and eliminate antidepressant effects. {\!firstname\_fix}, this one ingredient alone will bring out of you powers you always knew you had, but never was able to access\! 

**But that’s just the beginning…** 

Like I previously mentioned, there’s also an entirely different group of ingredients that make up Brain Fortius, which help you experience your Performer’s intellectual powers for as long as you live *(some of these ingredients may actually help you live longer).*

Imagine that, my friend. 

Knowing you have all you need to not only become the strongest version of yourself *instantly*, but to also maintain this level… with complete ease… for as long as you desire.  

Here is the group of ingredients that will help you do just that. 

**GROUP B: LONG NATURED INGREDIENTS** 

**Vitamin B12 (Methylcobalamin) \-** Vitamin B12 is a vital nutrient for your body, as it is used to support the DNA and RNA, provide energy, increase the production of serotonin, protect nerve and brain cells, and establish a positive go-lucky mood. 

However, you should know that there are two forms of vitamin B12 \- Methylcobalamin and Cyanocobalamin. Almost all supplements you come across use Cyanocobalamin because it is the cheaper of the two since it’s chemically synthesised. 

Brain Fortius, however, uses Methylcobalamin which is not only naturally occurring, but also the **most bioavailable form of vitamin B12**. This means it remains in your body for longer durations of time and at higher levels \- helping you combat and keep away fatigue, depression, anxiety and confusion. 

**Bacopa Monnieri Extract 20% Bacosides** \- Bacopa is a special type of plant that appears to increase certain brain functions that help you learn faster, retain more information, and recall this new found knowledge with complete ease. As a result, this plant has been used in traditional medicine to promote longevity and cognitive enhancement. 

It works by increasing the growth of nerve endings, so the speed at which the nervous system communicates is magnified. 

One important piece of information to point out is Brain Fortius uses Bacopa standardized to Bacosides (unlike other supplements with no standardization), which is the active ingredient in good Bacopa. This means you’re receiving the best of the best, and will be completely transformed in just 4-12 weeks. 

**Phosphatidylserine (20%) \-** Phosphatidylserine is an amino acid which exists in high amounts in the brain, where it helps promote cognitive functioning. In addition to improving the functioning of the brain, this amino acid also improves memory, lowers stress, improves mood, and promotes relaxation and sleep. 

More importantly, however, scientists are beginning to discover that it can also restore and bring to life previously damaged neurons\! That’s right, {\!firstname\_fix}… all the powers… all the abilities… all the talents… you may have lost throughout the years… could very well become available once again thanks to Phosphatidylserine. 

This special amino acid works by binding with neurotransmitters and enabling the brain to metabolize glucose more efficiently. This is important because it helps neurons communicate with one another at much faster rates, allowing you to experience the full potential of your brain and Performer Enneatype\! 

**Now my friend, I know you must be amazed at how powerful and effective the ingredients of Brain Fortius truly are.** 

But if you’re still skeptical, don’t worry. I don’t expect you to believe a single word I have told you. 

Instead, I encourage you to… 

**Judge The Benefits Of Brain Fortius For Yourself By Seeing What Scientists Have To Say About The Effectiveness Of Brain Fortius’ Ingredients:**

{\!firstname\_fix}, one of the most trusted resources in the field of science, *Examiner*, evaluated the effectiveness of the ingredients that make up Brain Fortius and came to the following conclusions (after conducting extensive independent scientific studies): 

***On Bacopa**: “Although requiring a long time to take effect (4-6 weeks), bacopa appears to reliably and effectively improve memory in both healthy persons and during cognitive decline.”  (Source: [School of Health and Human Sciences](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20590480))*

***On Vitamin B3:** “Niacin supplementation is currently the major reference for increasing HDL cholesterol concentrations rapidly and reliably, at times being called the Golden Standard for HDL increasing pharmaceuticals.” (Source: [Abbott Laboratories](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22085343))* 

***On Ginkgo:** “There appears to be a fairly reliable increase in short term memory and free recall associated with ginkgo supplementation.” (Source: [Human Cognitive Neuroscience Unit](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17457961), Division of Psychology, University of Northumbria, UK).* 

***On Rhodiola Rosea:** “The decrease in fatigue appears to be quite strong.” (Source: [Volgograd Medical Academy](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10839209))*

***On Alpha-GPC:** “The rate of cognitive decline of either degenerative or vascular origin appears to be significantly reduced with Alpha-GPC supplementation.” (Source: [Instituto Nacional de la Senectud](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12637119))*

*And that’s not even all the ingredients\!*

**\[Step-By-Step Analysis\] 6 Figure Copywriting Promotion** 

Below is the breakdown of a promotion I wrote pitching my copywriting services on freelance websites when I was still relatively new (but had some results under my belt). It converted. Like crazy.

**Target:** Established online business owner making 6-7 figures/yr who has previously gone through many copywriters, but all he got in return was smoke up his ass (copywriters making big claims) and little-to-no sales (weak conversions). All sizzle. No steak. 

**Where do they stand?** Level 3\. 

**How much do they know?** Solution Aware. 

**PROBLEM:** Can’t find a copywriter who actually delivers copy that converts.  
**BIG IDEA:** Copywriters will steal your $ (If you’re not careful)  
**Offer:** Copywriting services.  
**USP:** I’m a business owner (just like you) who turned into a copywriter out of necessity  
**BIG PROMISE:** I’ll create high-converting copy for you. Guaranteed.   
**UNIQUE MECHANISM:** Story of how I went from losing $10k with shit copywriter to killing it myself.   
**PROOF:** 6 figure business I built, $5000+ in 24 hours for a client etc. 

**\[Copy\] 6 Figure Copywriting Promotion** 

Hello\!  
   
My name is Tej Dosa and I’m a direct response marketer with vast experience in writing copy that makes cold hard cash (this past week I made my last client $5,524 in under 24 hours).  
   
But before I tell you about how I used my copywriting skills to build a six figure business and how I can help you do the same (disclaimer: only if I think you’re a good fit and someone I’d like to work with :) ) – I must ask you…  
   
Aren’t you tired of receiving endless applications from incompetent, amateur copywriters who simply want to squeeze you for every dollar your budget allows without delivering engaging copy that makes your business more money?  
   
I can relate.  
   
It's difficult to find a copywriter who not only understands your vision, but someone who can also deliver engaging copy that actually converts.  
   
What’s worse is the wrong hire can cost your company thousands in lost revenues – I once made the mistake of hiring the wrong copywriter and the copy cost me $10,000 –  but guess how much money the copy made my company?  
   
$147.   
   
Think it doesn’t get any worse? Oh, it does.   
   
I made the above mistake over and over again. It would have put my business out of business if it wasn’t for the one decision I made years ago…  
   
So what was the one decision I made that transformed my business from a failing business to a rock solid, competitor destroying empire that turned over six figures in just 14 short months?   
   
I mastered the art of writing engaging copy that actually converts. Not copy that sounds good or looks cute – but copy that makes cold hard cash.   
   
What’s even more is I've used my copywriting skills to make my clients a small fortune too. From SAAS to technology to health and wellness to self help – I’ve honed the art of writing engaging copy that actually converts in a wide variety of different industries.   
   
Below are three record breaking achievements I’m very proud to call my own:  
   
1\. Generated six figures in sales for the leading brands in the following industries: SAAS, beauty and wellness, business, fashion, real estate, psychology, and investing.   
   
2\. I built a blog from scratch to a million unique visitors in 14.5 months. I built the blog to a million plus views with a marketing budget of zero dollars. Instead of paid for marketing campaigns, I wrote one long form piece of engaging copy (3000-4000 words each) every single day for one full year (embedded in the copy were crucial SEO tactics). By doing so, I was able to build a loyal following of readers from over 75+ countries   
   
3\. Used copywriting to grow a YouTube channel from 200 views to 1,500,000+ views  
   
(Side note: Let me know if you’d like to contact any of my clients to verify my results \- I’ll send you an Excel file with names and emails and you can ask whichever questions you please).   
   
So with all that said – why should you hire me to write copy for your business?  
   
Because you require engaging, compelling copy that actually converts and I have the experience to create effective and appealing copy which makes your customers throw their wallets full of money at you.   
   
In fact, I’m so confident that I’m going to be your best performing copywriter – I’ll even throw in the following two guarantees:  
   
1\. I’ve been writing engaging copy for a variety of verticals and from doing so, I’ve honed the skill of working with urgency while still producing high quality work. Therefore, depending on your needs and preferences, I can assure you that I will have no problems meeting your terms (say goodbye to waiting weeks and months just to get back a lousy piece of copy).   
   
2\. I offer a personal guarantee. If you’re unhappy with the copy I produce for ANY REASON – don’t pay me a single dime. I want to absorb all the risk and ensure you receive great quality work you’re happy with.   
   
I'm willing to risk my time and energy to make you money while all you risk is higher profits.  
   
Sounds good? You bet.   
   
So what’s the catch?   
   
I only take on 5 new clients a month. And I’ve already pre-booked 4 for the month of August, however one final spot remains that will most likely fill up in the next hour or so. 

So if you’re interested, reply back to me ASAP and we’ll see if we’d make for a great fit.   
   
Tej   
   
P.S. I’m a native English speaker (born and raised in Vancouver, Canada) so communication will be no problem. I’m available on Skype at username: \[username\] (or email – \[email\]) throughout the day and communication between us will be fast, easy, and effective.

**Bonus 2 \- 100 Quick Hacks To Make Your Copy Convert (Crash Course)** 

**100 Quick Hacks To Make Your Copy Convert** 

Below are 100 quick tips to hone your copywriting chops (these are the ones I’ve learned either through resources, in the trenches, or through mistakes. I go through this list often. You should too). 

1\. More often than not this structure works the best: (A) Clear Headline (B) Declare The Problem (C) Present Your Solution (D) Demonstrate Credibility (E) Use Social Proof (F) Sprinkle In Testimonials (G) Use Clear Call To Action (H) Reverse All Risk (I) Anchor Price (Compare your price to more expensive alternatives to make it look like a great price) (J) FAQ (K) End With Clear Call To Action. 

2\. The first thing you should do when your customer buys from you is send him or her an email. What type of email? The type of email Gary Halbert calls the “thank you, please send more money” email. Simply thank them for their order and offer an incentive to order more. 

3\. Don’t discount your price. Makes you look cheap. And you lose your positioning. Instead offer a valuable bonus to the next XXX who buy now. 

4\. Don’t think in terms of products and services. Think in terms of “hungry markets.” 

5\. How you speak is how you should write. 

6\. Use short words. Short sentences. Short paragraphs. 

7\. The job of the headline is to get them to read your first sentence. The job of the first sentence is to get them to read the second sentence. The job of the second sentence is to get them to read the third sentence. And so on and so forth. (Hint: The shorter your sentences, the more people will continue reading). 

8\. Don’t write for non-buyers. Write for buyers. Include detail into your promotion. Lots of details. 

9\. Use everyday English. Avoid big words. 

10\. Every word matters. Delete any words that doesn’t advance your sales argument. I go over my copy with a highlighter and delete useless words. You should too. 

11\. The more you tell, the more you sell. 

12\. \[Gary Halbert Inspired\] The \#1 reason for marketing failure is that people simply don’t want what you are selling at all. The \#2 reason is that people don’t want it as much as they want the money they would have to give up for it. But, once you’ve overcome those first two reasons, then, the bigger joker left in the pack is that they don’t believe you. Give them details, details, details. 

13\. Admit your shortcomings if you want people to believe your strengths. 

14\. Proven sequence: Say something that gets attention. Tell them why they should be interested. Tell them why they should believe what you are saying is true. Prove it is true. Itemize and describe all the benefits. Tell them how to order. Tell them to order now. 

15\. Make your copy look like content. Not copy. 

16\. How to persuade in one sentence: People will do anything for those who encourage their dreams, justify their failures, allay their fears, confirm their suspicions and help them throw rocks at their enemies. 

17\. Read good fiction to build your empathy muscle. It’s the most important muscle a copywriter/marketer can have. Read A Thousand Splendid Suns. Read Travis Mcgee novels. 

18\. Good structure for ads: (A) Use A Question Hook. (B) Description Of Product (C) Call To Action. 

19\. Mistakes newbie copywriters make: (1) Write hype copy (2) Copy is not tight enough (it’s all over the place) (3) Outlandish claims (not enough proof). 

20\. The purpose of copy is to help people get what they want. Nothing more. Nothing less. 

21\. If you’re using a VSL (video sales letter) try putting the Add To Cart button above the video. Not below. Why? Some people get so consumed by your video they don’t even scroll down to see the ATC button. 

22\. Everything important should be above the fold. What’s “above the fold”? Everything you can see on your screen without having to scroll down. 

23\. Writing is a commodity. It’s words on page. Never sell words on a page. Sell profit. 

24\. Tell a story instead of facts, information, benefits, bullet-points, power-points, or whatever else you decide to present. 

25\. BIG IDEAS: People are excited by, and get behind, big visions and lofty goals. More money is thrown to back moonshots than some 10% improvement on an existing product. So find and proclaim a BIG IDEA. 

26\. A product for everyone is a product for no one. Create or invent specific products for specific people. 

27\. How to make your copy easier to read: short paragraphs (one liners if possible), 1.5 line spacing, bullet points, images, bold titles, quotes. 

28\. Repeat things often. Things to repeat: Money back guarantee; how easy it is to order; BIG IDEA; unique mechanism, proof, what they stand to gain.  

29\. FAQ section \= A smart way to address reader’s objections. 

30\. Use images in ads that interrupt brain patterns. More shocking the better. 

31\. Good structure for product pages (eCom): Hook; Description; Bullet points addressing objections; CTA. 

32\. Hand write great ads to learn structure. Use swiped.co 

33\. The job of bullets is to light up your target with desire. 

34\. Your bullets should NEVER give away the juice. It should tease the reader. If you’re selling a book, include page numbers of where they can quench their curiosity. (i.e. “The secret sauce that puts an extra $100 into your pockets” pg. 27\)

35\. Copywriting is salesmanship in print. Better you are at selling, better you’ll be at copywriting. Make a few cold calls to get better at copywriting. 

36\. Read psychology. Lots of it. Google “advertising experiments”. 

37\. Write copy as if you have a gun to your head. In other words, write as if you HAD to make your prospect buy with your copy (or else the gun would go off). 

38\. Never assume people will know what to do next (even if it’s obvious). Always tell them. “Here’s how to order: Click the button below, then you’ll see \_\_\_\_\_” 

39\. Write to the individual. Not to the masses. 

40\. Only talk about YOU when it benefits YOUR READER. 

41\. Proven formula: “I was just like you. I \[faced difficult problem\]. It was horrible. Gut wrenching. Awful. I had no clue how I would ever \[insert solution\]. But I was determined. So I tried. Failed. Tried. Failed. Almost gave up entirely. Till I came across \[product\].” In other words, show you’ve been where they are and you’ve felt the same emotions. Empathize.  

42\. If you want to sell a product for $97 than offer two other versions as well. One that sells for $197. And one that sells for $47. More often than not people will choose the $97 version (middle ground). 

43\. Under the ‘Add To Cart’ button on your upsell page include the following text: “xx% of our most successful students choose this option”. Leverage social proof. 

44\. People will skim your copy. After you’re done writing go back and just read the headlines and subheadlines and you should be able to get a good jist of what you’re selling/offering. If not, create better subheadings/headlines. 

45\. Copy cannot be too long. Only too boring. 

46\. Write your first draft, fast. Then take a day or two off. Come back with fresh eyes and edit.

47\. Use language your target uses. 

48\. Have a swipe file. Create a folder on your computer now. And save ads, sales letters, VSL’s whatever into this folder. Build it up. It’ll turn into your most valuable asset. 

49\. Your buyer should want what you’re selling more than you want to sell it. 

50\. Ask questions that get readers to say “yes”. 

51\. Appeal to these powerful emotional patterns: fear, greed, guilt, exclusivity, anger, salvation, flattery. 

52\. Every word tells a story. Pick your words wisely. 

53\. Be specific. Avoid generalities. (Ex. “I made hundreds of thousands in 6 months” is not very believable. “I made $192,920.92 in 176 days” is much more believable).

54\. Write at a grade 5 level. 

55\. Emotion \> Logic (but logic matters too). 

56\. Proven Formula: AIDA. (A)ttention (I)nterest (D)esire (A)ction. 

57\. Good copy educates, it doesn’t sell. Why? People love to buy, but hate to be sold. 

58\. Forget all the writing rules you learned in school. Break the rules. 

59\. Use an easy to read font. 

60\. Give yourself a word limit: XXXX words. The purpose of this exercise to help you get to the point fast and keep your copy tight (otherwise you may write sloppy copy).

61\. Edit multiple times. Go for a walk before you edit. Trust me. 

62\. Create open loops to keep people interested. Have you seen Lost? Remember how they would create a shit ton of open loops? Do that with your copy. 

63\. One of the best ways to start your copy is by asking questions your target will say yes to. 

64\. If you know your target is busy the first sentence should convey the most important point you want to get across. 

65\. Use an active voice. 

66\. Use power words. Google ‘John Carlton Power Words’. 

67\. Proven Formula: PAR. (P)roblem (A)gitate (R)esolve. 

68\. Define your audience and speak ONLY to your audience. Forget everyone else. 

69\. Don’t assume your readers are stupid. Your readers are your mom. 

70\. Avoid fake urgency/scarcity (you’ll ruin your reputation). 

71\. Personalize the hell out of your copy. Use your reader’s name wherever you can.

72\. Proven Formula: PAPA. (P)roblem (A)dvantages of solving the problem (P)roof that you can solve it. (A)ction. 

73\. Be concise. 

74\. Use “you” more than “I”. 

75\. Have a unique style/tone. This comes with practice. Keep practising. 

76\. Study 2-3 copywriters inside out. Don’t study just one. Why? Then you’ll just become a carbon copy of that copywriter. Mistake. By studying 2-3 you’ll be able to see multiple styles. And will be better off. Copywriters I recommend: Gary Halbert, John Carlton, Joe Sugarman, Dan Kennedy. 

77\. Give people a reason to do what you’re asking. Always. “Order today because\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.” Because is the most persuasive word according to science. People need reasons. Any reason will do. 

78\. Sell people what they want to buy. 

79\. People are more likely to buy when they are at an emotional turning point (lost a loved one, going through a breakup, filed for divorce, went bankrupt etc.)

80\. You don’t want your reader to know you are selling him something until you are well into your pitch. 

81\. Use transition words. Don’t break the flow. 

82\. Use sentences and words that trigger visual imagery. 

83\. Read your coup out loud. Why? You’ll stumble across certain sentences and words. Make these simpler. 

84\. Always find a hot market first. Then a product. 

85\. Believability is crucial. Instead of saying “all real estate agent” say “69.2% of real estate agents”. 

86\. Copy does not create desire. It only channels and directs it. 

87\. Sell your product or service like a reporter would. Make it seem like a ‘review’. 

88\. Use real testimonials, but get them from your customers in this formula: “At first I thought \[your product\] would \[insert objection\]. But then I bit the bullet and got it and \[insert pleasant experience/how it overcame objection\].”

89\. Make your first sentence hypnotic. Irresistible. 

90\. Rule \#1 of marketing: When everybody else is doing X, do Y. 

91\. Experiment with text on Add To Cart buttons. ‘Add To Bag’ has been converting higher for physical products. 

92\. Your headline should only contain ONE IDEA. 

93\. Review your copy to make sure every potential objection a target could have is addressed. 

94\. The purpose of copy is to trigger the “I have to get this feeling” \-- check your copy and note the moment a target will feel this. If he wouldn’t, you have some work to do. 

95\. Don’t spend too much time hammering and agitating the problem--you might create paralysis analysis in your target. Shed light onto it and move onto the solution. 

96\. Good copy should communicate two things: 1\) You Care 2\) You Have Something Valuable To Offer

97\. Never assume something is too basic for your target. Always explain. 

98\. To get one powerful headline, write 10 shitty headlines. 

99\. Spend 80% of your time on: finding a BIG IDEA, Unique Mechanism and Irresistible Offer. And writing a powerful headline and irresistible lead. Do this and you have a winning promotion. 

100\. Never make judgments about your copy based on what a NON-TARGET has to say about it. “It’s too long. “Who would read that?” Ignore. Ignore. Ignore.
