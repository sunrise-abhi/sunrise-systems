**Solution:** Complete custom Procore replacement with advanced integrations  
**Investment:** $21,000 invested to date (estimated ~$50,000 total)  
**Timeline:** 3 weeks from kickoff to delivery

- **Full team adoption** across project management and estimating
- **Reduced communication time** (eliminated "figuring out what's going on")
- **Complete project transparency** for internal team, clients, and subs
- **Simple, intuitive interface** that everyone actually uses

**Strategic Impact:**
- **They control the roadmap** (not Procore)
- **No vendor lock-in** (they own the code)
- **Integrates with THEIR tools** (not Procore's partners)
- **Scales with growth** (no per-user pricing increases)
- **Competitive advantage** through custom features competitors can't access

#### Core Platform Features

**Project Management:**
- Full RFI infrastructure

#### Cost Comparison

| Solution | Year 1 | Year 5 | Year 10 | Ownership |
|----------|--------|--------|---------|-----------|
| **Procore** | $35,000 | $175,000+ | $350,000+ | ❌ You rent it |
| **Custom Build** | $50,000* | $50,000 + minimal maintenance | $50,000 + minimal maintenance | ✅ **You own it** |

*Estimated total investment (currently $21K invested, development ongoing)

**5-Year Savings: $125,000+**  
**10-Year Savings: $300,000+**

#### Development Process: Agile, Not Waterfall

Unlike Procore's "take it or leave it" approach:
- **Monthly discovery sessions** to understand evolving needs
- **Iterative development** that adapted as they learned
- **Regular demos and feedback** to ensure alignment
- **Transparent development progress** visible in client portal
- **Result:** They got EXACTLY what they envisioned, not what vendor decided

#### Key Insight: Transparency

*"The biggest thing is transparency—both in the working relationship with us and in the product itself. Complete visibility into what's happening with projects, what employees are doing, what clients can see, what subs can access. Procore tries to do this, but you're still sorting through emails and figuring out what's going on. Our solution eliminates that."*

## Breakthrough Lighting

**Client:** Breakthrough Lighting (Lighting Distribution/Procurement Specialist)  
**Investment:** $13,500 actual (9 months) | $27,000 calculated value  
**Timeline:** December 2024 - October 2025 (10 months)  
**Target:** Electrical Contractors, Interior Designers, Architects (California)  
**Current Rate:** ~$2,100/month for ongoing services

### Key Results

- **$20,000 closed revenue** (first confirmed project)
- **$10 million in qualified pipeline** generated (Joe's direct attribution)
- **$15.67M total opportunities quoted** in 2025 vs. $13.7M in 2024
- **$2M year-over-year growth** despite market turmoil
- **25-30% increase in new relationships** vs. organic baseline
- **20% more project opportunities** vs. pre-engagement
- **Access to larger GCs and design-build firms** through bid lists
- **Pipeline ROI: 740:1** ($10M ÷ $13.5K)
- **Cost per opportunity: ~$300** (comparable to previous vendor but with higher effectiveness)

### Performance Metrics

**Pipeline Generation:**
- **$15.67M total opportunities quoted** in 2025 (vs. $13.7M in 2024)
- **$2M year-over-year growth** despite market challenges
- **$10M directly attributed to systematic BD** (Joe's assessment: 64% of total pipeline)
- **Pipeline ROI: 740:1**

**Relationship & Opportunity Growth:**
- **25-30% more new relationships** generated vs. organic baseline
- **20% more project opportunities** vs. pre-engagement period
- **Access to bigger players:** "Getting on vendor lists with bigger design-build guys, bigger contractors"
- **Recurring bid invitations:** "Several jobs from bid lists, some getting repeat requests"

**Efficiency Gains:**
- **"Doing more with less":** Lower email volume (~1,000/month vs. 1,500 with PersistIQ)
- **Higher conversion rates:** "The percentages are higher in terms of responses per email"
- **Better targeting:** "You guys came in, cleaned it up, and were more effective reaching out"
- **Cost per opportunity: ~$300** (same as PersistIQ but superior effectiveness)

### Market Context: Growth Despite Adversity

Joe's assessment of 2025 market conditions:

*"2025, we've had the rollercoaster of tariffs and uncertainty and jobs being put on hold... This is not the greatest year to compare year-over-year improvements because of turmoil. The fact that we had such a nice bump anyway speaks volumes of the work that you guys did, the groundwork that we've laid for ourselves."*

**Despite market challenges:**
- Tariff uncertainty
- Projects on hold
- Market volatility
- Interest rate concerns

**Breakthrough Lighting still achieved $2M growth in qualified opportunities.**

### The "Three-Legged Stool" Framework

Joe positions systematic BD as one of three critical growth drivers:

1. **CRM/HubSpot:** Organizing and tracking all relationships
2. **NetSuite:** Operational efficiency and financial management
3. **Systematic BD (Sunrise):** Consistent relationship generation and outreach

*"The legs to the stool are basically, you know, our CRM, it's NetSuite, and you guys, the three-legged stool."*

### Attribution Framework (Client's Own Words)

Joe's honest assessment:

*"The one thing where it's a challenge, Jason, is that because I had hired business development managers prior to bringing you guys on board, and they were already actively pursuing a lot of these same type of customers, it's hard for me to say at this point which ones came as a result of the outreach and which ones came as a result of the internal outreach."*

**His conclusion:** *"I would venture to say that it was probably a third was because of them, and maybe two-thirds was because of you guys, because you guys sort of came in, cleaned it up, and you were more effective reaching out to some of these people."*

**This means: $10M of $15.67M attributed to systematic BD = 64% of total pipeline.**

### Proof Point: The Persistence Example

Recent success story demonstrates the process:
- Interior designer didn't respond until **3rd outreach attempt**
- Response led to **Zoom call** (set up by BD team)
- Zoom call led to **project with drawings and renderings sent**
- Now in active pipeline

*"That was all you guys, you know, making the contact, because I believe she didn't answer until the third attempt. She finally said, okay, you know, what do you guys have set up? And then that turned into the Zoom, and then the Zoom turned into the opportunity."* —Joe

### ROI Comparison: Previous Vendor vs. Current

| Metric | PersistIQ (Before) | Systematic BD (Current) |
|--------|-------------------|------------------------|
| **Monthly Cost** | $1,500 | $1,500 (avg) |
| **Email Volume** | 1,500/month | ~1,000/month |
| **Relationships Generated** | 5/month | Higher rate |
| **Cost Per Relationship** | $300 | ~$300 |
| **Conversion Rate** | Baseline | **Higher** |
| **Quality of Targeting** | Standard | **"More effective"** |
| **Pipeline Generated** | Unknown | **$10M (9 months)** |
| **Strategic Partnership** | ❌ No | ✅ **Yes** |
| **Integration with Internal Team** | ❌ Minimal | ✅ **Complementary** |

**Key Insight:** Similar cost per relationship, but **superior targeting, higher conversion rates, and strategic integration** = massively better results.

### Access to Larger Players

**Before Systematic BD:**
- Primarily smaller GCs and repeat referrals
- Limited bid list access
- Reactive (waiting for inbound)

**After ConstructConnect Targeting:**
- Access to **bigger design-build firms**
- **Vendor list additions** with larger GCs
- **Recurring bid invitations** ("they start sending you bids")
- **15-20% more project opportunities** through ConstructConnect alone
- **Several jobs from bid lists** (ongoing revenue)
- **Repeat requests for bids** from same contractors

Joe's assessment: *"We definitely have gotten, as a result of that, into more of the bid vendor lists, you know, because the ConstructConnect has enabled us to access bigger design-build guys, bigger contractors. And so those you get on the vendor list, and then they start sending you bids. So they keep us busy."*

### Client Testimonials

*"I'd be comfortable giving you credit for 10 million of opportunities... The fact that we had such a nice bump anyway, you know, speaks volumes of the work that you guys did, the groundwork that we've laid for ourselves. It's a pretty healthy increase still, you know, in just quoting opportunities, $2 million extra. It's nothing to... that's several more jobs that we didn't get a look at that we didn't even get to sniff the year before."*

*"We're doing more, we're doing more with less, you know, we're being, the percentages are higher in terms of, you know, the responses that we're getting per number of emails that we're sending out, but we're also sending less emails."*

*"You guys sort of came in, cleaned it up, and you were more effective reaching out to some of these people."*

*"We're getting access to people that we weren't getting access to before, thanks to that campaign."*

*"Whatever you need from me in terms of a testimony, Jason, I'd be more than happy, man, because, you know, you guys have helped us out... We still think of you guys as a strategic partner more than anything else."*

## EFI

### Data Rescue - Software

**Challenge:** 13 years of dormant project data (1994-2007) trapped in inaccessible Access database  
**Solution:** Custom data extraction, migration to modern cloud infrastructure  
**Investment:** $4,461 (one-time)  
**Timeline:** 3 weeks from kickoff to delivery  
**Value Unlocked:** $50M in historical project data, 4,000 lost contacts, 1,400 projects

### Key Results

**Data Recovered:**
- **$50M in historical project data** recovered and accessible
- **4,000 lost client contacts** identified for relationship reactivation
- **1,400 projects analyzed** for strategic insights
- **Already in active use:** "We're pulling some of the data today to use with a client, it's been very helpful!" —EFI Team
- **Foundation for unlimited future builds:** Sage integration, custom dashboards, reporting—all on their timeline

**Technical Deliverables:**
- Custom extraction scripts from legacy Access database
- Modern cloud Postgres database on Railway
- NocoDB deployment (open-source database management)
