## **TOP 3 CASE STUDY ANGLES FOR DBIA AUDIENCE:**

---

### **ü•á \#1: "The $35K/Year Procore Rebellion" \- Economics \+ Ownership Story ‚≠ê STRONGEST**

**Headline:** *"How Delta Construction Is Replacing Procore for $50K One-Time vs. $175K+ Over 5 Years"*

**Why This DESTROYS at DBIA:**

* **Everyone knows Procore** (and most are frustrated with pricing)  
* **Every GC in the room** is paying $25K-$100K+/year for construction software  
* **"Replacing Procore"** \= immediate credibility (if you can replace Procore, you can build anything)  
* **Clear rebellion narrative:** "We said NO to recurring fees"  
* **Ownership story** resonates with entrepreneurial GC mindset

**Full Positioning:**

## **"We're Done Renting Software": How Delta Construction Fired Procore**

### **The Procore Problem**

Delta Construction was facing a problem every growing GC faces:

**The Procore Tax:**

* ‚ùå $35,000+/year subscription (and rising as revenue grows)  
* ‚ùå Slow platform performance  
* ‚ùå Features that "almost" fit their workflow (but not quite)  
* ‚ùå Limited client portal capabilities  
* ‚ùå Subcontractor interface that subs struggled to use  
* ‚ùå No way to get the custom integrations they actually needed  
* ‚ùå **$175,000+ over 5 years** for software they'd never own

**And when they asked Procore for custom features?**  
 *"That's not on our roadmap. Maybe next year. Keep paying."*

### **The Breaking Point**

Delta had a **vision** for how their project management should work:

* Clients logging in to see real-time project status, invoices, and progress  
* Subcontractors easily accessing deliverables, due dates, and schedules  
* Integration with their existing tools (BIM 360, Sage, QuickBooks)  
* Fast, intuitive interface that matched their workflow  
* Complete project transparency across the entire organization

**Procore couldn't deliver this. And even if they could, Delta would never own it.**

### **The Custom Solution: Build What You Own**

We partnered with Delta to build a **complete Procore replacement** that includes:

#### **Core Project Management Platform:**

‚úÖ Full RFI infrastructure  
 ‚úÖ Comprehensive bidding system  
 ‚úÖ Document management and version control  
 ‚úÖ Project scheduling and tracking  
 ‚úÖ Financial management and invoicing

#### **Advanced Integrations (Procore Can't Do This):**

‚úÖ **Two-way QuickBooks Online sync** (real-time financial data)  
 ‚úÖ **Autodesk BIM 360 integration** (pull design data directly)  
 ‚úÖ **Sage/Lumber integration** (materials and accounting)  
 ‚úÖ **Custom financial reporting** from their actual systems

#### **Client Portal (Better Than Procore):**

‚úÖ Real-time project status visibility  
 ‚úÖ Invoice access and payment tracking  
 ‚úÖ Project data and progress updates  
 ‚úÖ Communication tools  
 ‚úÖ **Branded to Delta, not generic Procore interface**

#### **Subcontractor Portal (Actually Easy to Use):**

‚úÖ Simple login and dashboard  
 ‚úÖ Deliverables and due dates at a glance  
 ‚úÖ Schedule coordination  
 ‚úÖ Communication threads per project  
 ‚úÖ **Built for subs who aren't tech experts**

#### **Bonus: CRM & Estimating System (Not Even Available in Procore):**

‚úÖ Dynamic lead tracking (no more spreadsheets\!)  
 ‚úÖ Estimating pipeline management  
 ‚úÖ Custom lead scoring algorithms  
 ‚úÖ Bid due dates, project dates, cost tracking  
 ‚úÖ **Integrated with outreach system** (automatic CRM entries)  
 ‚úÖ Newsletter management  
 ‚úÖ Team collaboration and follow-ups

### **The Development Process: Agile, Not Waterfall**

Unlike Procore's "take it or leave it" approach, we worked with Delta through:

* **Monthly discovery sessions** to understand evolving needs  
* **Iterative development** that adapted as they learned what they wanted  
* **Regular demos and feedback** to ensure alignment  
* **Transparent development progress** visible in their client portal

**Result:** They got **exactly** what they envisioned, not what a vendor decided for them.

### **The Economics: Ownership Changes Everything**

| Solution | Year 1 | Year 5 | Year 10 | Ownership |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Procore** | $35,000 | $175,000+ | $350,000+ | ‚ùå You rent it |
| **Custom Build** | $50,000\* | $50,000 \+ minimal maintenance | $50,000 \+ minimal maintenance | ‚úÖ **You own it** |

\*Estimated total investment (currently $21K invested, development ongoing)

**5-Year Savings: $125,000+**  
 **10-Year Savings: $300,000+**

### **The Results**

**Operational Impact:**

* ‚úÖ **25-30% increase in operational efficiency** (estimated)  
* ‚úÖ **Full team adoption** across project management and estimating  
* ‚úÖ **Reduced communication time** (no more "figuring out what's going on")  
* ‚úÖ **Complete project transparency** for internal team, clients, and subs  
* ‚úÖ **Simple, intuitive interface** that everyone actually uses

**Strategic Impact:**

* ‚úÖ **They control the roadmap** (not Procore)  
* ‚úÖ **No vendor lock-in** (they own the code)  
* ‚úÖ **Integrates with THEIR tools** (not Procore's partners)  
* ‚úÖ **Scales with their growth** (no per-user pricing increases)  
* ‚úÖ **Competitive advantage** through custom features competitors can't access

### **The Key Insight: Transparency**

As Delta's development team noted: *"The biggest thing is transparency‚Äîboth in the working relationship with us and in the product itself. Complete visibility into what's happening with projects, what employees are doing, what clients can see, what subs can access. Procore tries to do this, but you're still sorting through emails and figuring out what's going on. Our solution eliminates that."*

### **Why This Matters for Your Firm**

**If you're a GC paying $25K-$100K+/year for Procore, Buildertrend, or similar platforms, ask yourself:**

1. Are you getting the features you actually need, or just what the vendor offers?  
2. Does your client portal actually impress clients, or is it generic?  
3. Can your subs use the system easily, or do they avoid it?  
4. Can you integrate with the tools you actually use?  
5. Will you ever own the software, or pay forever?

**Delta asked these questions and decided to build instead of rent.**

**After Year 2, they're saving money. After Year 5, they've saved $125,000+. After Year 10, they've saved $300,000+.**

**And they own it forever.**

### **ü•à \#2: "The Agile Development Story" \- Process \+ Partnership Narrative**

**Headline:** *"Unlike Procore's 'Take It or Leave It' Model, We Built Exactly What Delta Envisioned‚ÄîAnd Adapted as They Learned"*

**Why This Resonates:**

* **Addresses fear:** "What if we don't know exactly what we want?"  
* **Shows partnership:** Not transactional vendor relationship  
* **Demonstrates flexibility:** Not locked into rigid specs  
* **Highlights control:** They drive the roadmap, not us

**Full Positioning:**

## **"We Don't Know What We Want Yet"‚ÄîAnd That's Okay: The Agile Advantage**

### **The SaaS Problem: One-Size-Fits-All**

When Delta Construction decided to replace Procore, they had a vision‚Äîbut not a complete specification. They knew:

* Procore was too slow and too expensive  
* They needed better client and sub portals  
* They wanted integrations Procore couldn't provide  
* They wanted transparency Procore didn't offer

**But the details? Those emerged through the build process.**

### **Why SaaS Fails Here**

With Procore, Buildertrend, or any SaaS platform, you get:

* ‚ùå What's on the feature list (take it or leave it)  
* ‚ùå Integrations the vendor chose (not the ones you need)  
* ‚ùå UI/UX the vendor designed (not what works for your team)  
* ‚ùå The vendor's roadmap (not yours)  
* ‚ùå No flexibility to adapt as you learn

**And if you say "we need something different"?**  
 *"Submit a feature request. We'll consider it. Keep paying."*

### **The Custom Alternative: Build, Learn, Adapt**

Instead of forcing Delta into a predetermined mold, we partnered with them through an **agile development process:**

#### **Discovery & Iteration (Not Waterfall)**

* **Monthly discovery sessions** to understand evolving needs  
* **Regular demos** to validate direction  
* **Feedback loops** that shaped the next sprint  
* **Flexibility to pivot** when they discovered better approaches

#### **Transparent Progress Tracking**

* **Real-time visibility** into development status via their client portal  
* **Clear communication** about what's being built and why  
* **No black box** development‚Äîthey see exactly what's happening

#### **Examples of Mid-Build Pivots:**

**Original Idea:** "We need a subcontractor portal where they can see deliverables."

**What We Learned Mid-Build:** "Actually, subs also need to coordinate schedules and have project-specific communication threads. Can we add that?"

**SaaS Response:** "Not on our roadmap."  
 **Our Response:** "Let's add it in the next sprint."

---

**Original Idea:** "We want QuickBooks integration."

**What We Learned Mid-Build:** "We actually need TWO-WAY sync so project data flows both directions, not just one way."

**SaaS Response:** "Our API doesn't support that."  
 **Our Response:** "We'll build custom sync logic."

---

**Original Idea:** "We want client visibility into project status."

**What We Learned Mid-Build:** "Clients also want to see invoices, payment history, and real-time updates‚Äînot just static reports."

**SaaS Response:** "Upgrade to Enterprise tier for $15K more/year."  
 **Our Response:** "We'll build it into your portal."

### **The Result: They Got Exactly What They Envisioned (And More)**

Because we stayed agile and adaptive, Delta ended up with:

* ‚úÖ Features they discovered they needed mid-build  
* ‚úÖ Integrations that actually solve their problems  
* ‚úÖ UI/UX that matches their workflow (not ours)  
* ‚úÖ A system their team actually loves using

**And the team adoption proves it:** 100% adoption of the CRM/estimating system, full operational integration of the project management platform.

### **Compare This to SaaS:**

| Factor | Custom Development | SaaS Platform |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Flexibility** | Adapt as you learn | Locked into feature set |
| **Discovery Process** | Iterative, collaborative | "Here's a demo, sign the contract" |
| **Mid-Project Changes** | Expected and accommodated | "Not on roadmap" |
| **Your Influence** | You drive the roadmap | Submit feature requests |
| **Final Product** | Exactly what you need | Close enough (maybe) |

### **The Philosophy: Simplicity Through Complexity**

As our development team puts it: *"We try to keep very complex problems very simple. The CRM/estimating system is robust and detailed, but someone who doesn't use it every day can look at it and understand what's going on. That's intentional."*

**Simple interfaces. Complex problems solved. No bloat.**

### **Why This Matters**

Most GCs don't replace Procore because they think:

* "We don't know exactly what we'd want instead"  
* "What if we spec it wrong and waste money?"  
* "Custom development sounds rigid and risky"

**Delta proved these fears wrong.**

They started with a vision, not a specification. They adapted as they learned. They ended up with exactly what they needed.

**And they'll never pay Procore's $35K/year again.**

---

### **ü•â \#3: "The Feature Superiority Story" \- Technical Differentiation**

**Headline:** *"3 Things Delta's Custom Platform Does That Procore Can't (Or Won't)"*

**Why This Works:**

* **Demonstrates technical superiority** over industry standard  
* **Shows specific value** beyond just "cheaper"  
* **Appeals to tech-savvy GCs** who know Procore's limitations  
* **Proves custom isn't just "copying Procore"**‚Äîit's better

**Full Positioning:**

## **Beyond Procore: Features the Market Leader Can't Deliver**

Delta Construction didn't just want a cheaper Procore. They wanted a **better** platform. Here's what they got:

---

### **Feature \#1: True Two-Way Financial Integration**

**What Procore Offers:**

* One-way data sync from Procore to accounting  
* Manual reconciliation still required  
* Financial data lives in separate systems  
* Reports don't match between platforms

**What Delta's Custom Platform Offers:**  
 ‚úÖ **Two-way QuickBooks Online synchronization**  
 ‚úÖ **Real-time financial data** flows both directions  
 ‚úÖ **Automatic reconciliation** eliminates manual work  
 ‚úÖ **Single source of truth** for project finances  
 ‚úÖ **Custom financial reports** that pull from actual accounting data

**Why This Matters:**  
 Project managers see accurate financial data in real-time. Accountants see accurate project data in real-time. No manual reconciliation. No data conflicts.

**Procore can't do this** because their API limitations don't support true two-way sync at this depth.

---

### **Feature \#2: Client-Facing Portal That Actually Impresses Clients**

**What Procore Offers:**

* Generic client portal with Procore branding  
* Basic project updates and document sharing  
* Limited customization  
* Feels like "another construction software login"

**What Delta's Custom Platform Offers:**  
 ‚úÖ **Fully branded to Delta** (looks like their website, not Procore)  
 ‚úÖ **Real-time project status** with visual progress indicators  
 ‚úÖ **Invoice and payment history** in one place  
 ‚úÖ **Project data and updates** tailored to what clients actually care about  
 ‚úÖ **Communication tools** designed for client ease-of-use  
 ‚úÖ **Mobile-responsive** interface that works everywhere

**Why This Matters:**  
 Clients see Delta's brand, not Procore's. They get transparency that builds trust. They have a better experience than competitors' clients using generic portals.

**This becomes a competitive advantage in bidding.**

---

### **Feature \#3: Subcontractor Portal That Subs Actually Use**

**What Procore Offers:**

* Complex interface designed for GCs, not subs  
* Subs complain it's too complicated  
* Training burden on both GC and sub  
* Many subs avoid using it (resort to email/calls)

**What Delta's Custom Platform Offers:**  
 ‚úÖ **Simple, intuitive interface** designed specifically for subs  
 ‚úÖ **At-a-glance dashboard** showing deliverables and due dates  
 ‚úÖ **Schedule coordination tools** that match how subs actually work  
 ‚úÖ **Project-specific communication threads** (no cluttered inbox)  
 ‚úÖ **Mobile-first design** for field use  
 ‚úÖ **Minimal training required** (subs can figure it out themselves)

**Why This Matters:**  
 When subs actually use the system, Delta gets:

* Better communication  
* Fewer delays  
* More accurate schedules  
* Less time wasted tracking down information

**Procore's sub portal is built for their market (large enterprises). Delta's is built for their actual subs.**

---

### **Bonus: CRM & Estimating System (Procore Doesn't Even Try)**

**What Procore Offers:**

* Project management after you win the job  
* Nothing for lead tracking or estimating pipeline  
* You need separate software (and another subscription)

**What Delta's Custom Platform Offers:**  
 ‚úÖ **Integrated CRM** that tracks all leads and opportunities  
 ‚úÖ **Estimating pipeline management** with custom scoring algorithms  
 ‚úÖ **Bid due dates, project dates, estimated costs** all tracked  
 ‚úÖ **Automatic CRM entries** from outreach activity  
 ‚úÖ **Newsletter management** and client communication  
 ‚úÖ **Team collaboration and follow-ups** built in

**Results:**

* 25-30% operational efficiency increase  
* No more scattered spreadsheets  
* Dynamic, real-time visibility into pipeline  
* Full team adoption

**This isn't just "replacing Procore"‚Äîit's replacing Procore \+ Salesforce \+ HubSpot \+ spreadsheets.**

---

### **The Economic Reality**

To get what Delta built, you'd need:

* Procore ($35K/year)  
* Advanced QuickBooks integration ($5K-$10K/year)  
* CRM platform ($3K-$10K/year)  
* Custom client portal solution ($5K-$15K/year)  
* Estimating software ($2K-$5K/year)

**Total: $50K-$75K/year in subscriptions**  
 **5-Year Cost: $250K-$375K**

**Delta's Investment: \~$50K one-time**  
 **5-Year Cost: \~$50K (plus minimal maintenance)**

**5-Year Savings: $200K-$325K**

**And they own it all.**

## **ADDITIONAL POSITIONING ANGLES:**

---

### **Angle \#4: "The Spreadsheet Rebellion" \- CRM/Estimating Story**

**Headline:** *"From Scattered Spreadsheets to 25-30% Efficiency Gains: Delta's CRM Revolution"*

**Hook:** Every GC has "the estimating spreadsheet" that 10 people edit

**Story:**

* Delta's estimating pipeline was tracked in spreadsheets  
* Updated monthly (out of date immediately)  
* Everyone editing the same file (version control nightmare)  
* Changes don't propagate to everyone  
* No way to score leads or track follow-ups systematically  
* **Sound familiar?**

**Solution:**

* Custom CRM with estimating pipeline tracking  
* Lead scoring algorithms  
* Automatic entries from outreach activity  
* Newsletter integration  
* Team collaboration built-in  
* Real-time updates (no versioning issues)

**Results:**

* 25-30% operational efficiency increase  
* 100% team adoption  
* Dynamic, always-current pipeline view  
* Simple interface anyone can understand at a glance

**Why SaaS Fails Here:**

* Salesforce is overkill and expensive ($$$)  
* Generic CRMs don't understand construction estimating  
* Most GCs resort to spreadsheets because "nothing fits"  
* Delta proved custom can be simpler AND better than generic SaaS

---

### **Angle \#5: "The Internal Proof" \- We Use What We Build**

**Headline:** *"We Don't Just Build Custom Software for Clients‚ÄîWe Run Our Entire Business on It"*

**Hook:** Proof we believe in custom solutions

**Story:**

* Sunrise builds custom software for clients  
* **We also build it for ourselves**  
* ContentSphere: Custom content management for marketing deliverables  
* Custom client portal: Shows outreach data, marketing pipeline, software development progress  
* Custom outreach tracking system: Low-level sales activity data  
* **We solved our own problems with custom software because nothing on the market worked**

**Why This Matters:**

* We practice what we preach  
* We understand operational efficiency from custom tools  
* We know the pain of "almost right" SaaS platforms  
* **We chose custom for ourselves‚Äîsame reasons you should**

**Positioning:**

"We started from the beginning with custom solutions. It's our identity. We find the most optimal way to solve problems, not the easiest path to recurring revenue. That's why we build for ownership, not subscriptions."

---

### **Angle \#6: "The Transparency Advantage" \- Communication Efficiency**

**Headline:** *"The Biggest Procore Problem Isn't Features‚ÄîIt's Wasted Time Figuring Out What's Going On"*

**Hook:** How much time does your team waste just trying to understand project status?

**Story:**

* Procore has communication tools, but you're still sorting through emails  
* People waste hours just figuring out what they should be working on  
* Information is scattered across threads, documents, emails  
* **Delta's custom platform eliminates this**

**Features That Drive Transparency:**

* Communication channels built into the platform  
* Project status visible at a glance  
* Clear action items and deliverables  
* No more "detective work" to figure out what's happening  
* Clients see everything in real-time  
* Subs see everything they need  
* Internal team has complete visibility

**Result:**

"One of the biggest things is cutting down communication time‚Äîthat feeling of wasting time because you don't know what's going on. With our platform, it's clear what exactly is happening." ‚ÄîDelta Development Team

**ROI:**

* If 10 employees save 1 hour/week \= 520 hours/year  
* At $50/hour loaded cost \= **$26,000/year in productivity recovered**  
* This alone justifies the investment

## **DBIA BOOTH MESSAGING:**

### **Primary Hook (Stop Traffic):**

*"We're Helping Delta Construction Fire Procore and Save $125K+ Over 5 Years"*

### **Elevator Pitch (30 Seconds):**

"Delta Construction was paying $35K/year for Procore, and it was slow, expensive, and didn't fit their vision. We're building them a complete custom replacement‚ÄîRFIs, bidding, client/sub portals, QuickBooks integration, CRM, estimating‚Äîfor $50K one-time. After Year 2, they're saving money. After Year 5, they've saved $125K+. And they own it forever. SaaS wants you to rent. We help you own."

### **Qualifying Questions:**

1. "How much are you paying annually for Procore, Buildertrend, or similar platforms?"  
2. "Are you getting all the features you actually need, or just what the vendor offers?"  
3. "Do your clients and subs love using your project management software, or do they tolerate it?"  
4. "Can you integrate your accounting system the way you actually want to?"  
5. "Have you ever thought 'I wish we could just build exactly what we need'?"

### **Objection Handlers:**

**Objection:** "We've invested so much in Procore training and workflows."  
 **Response:** "Delta felt the same way. But ask yourself: are you optimizing workflows around Procore's limitations, or around what actually works best? And is the switching cost higher than $35K/year forever? After Year 2 with custom, you're ahead‚Äîand you're not locked in anymore."

**Objection:** "Custom development sounds risky."  
 **Response:** "What's riskier: paying $35K/year forever for software you don't fully control, or investing $50K once to own something built for your exact needs? Delta chose ownership. Plus, we use agile development‚Äîmonthly check-ins, iterative builds, transparent progress. You see exactly what you're getting."

**Objection:** "What if Procore adds the features we need?"  
 **Response:** "They might. In 2-3 years. After you've submitted feature requests. While you keep paying. And even then, will it work exactly how you need? Delta got tired of waiting. They built what they needed in months, not years."

**Objection:** "What about ongoing maintenance?"  
 **Response:** "Minimal compared to $35K/year. You own the code. You can hire us for updates, hire someone else, or build in-house. Compare that to Procore's escalating subscription costs as you grow. Which sounds more sustainable?"

**Objection:** "We don't know exactly what we'd want."  
 **Response:** "Delta didn't either. That's why we use agile development‚Äîmonthly discovery sessions, iterative builds, flexibility to adapt as you learn. You don't need perfect specs upfront. You need a partner who'll build with you, not at you."

## **STRONGEST POSITIONING FOR DBIA:**

I'd lead with **Angle \#1 ("The $35K/Year Procore Rebellion")** because:

‚úÖ **Universal pain point:** Everyone at DBIA knows Procore  
 ‚úÖ **Rebellion narrative:** "We said NO" resonates with entrepreneurial GCs  
 ‚úÖ **Clear economics:** $50K once vs. $175K+ over 5 years is undeniable  
 ‚úÖ **Ownership story:** Appeals to GC mindset of building/owning assets  
 ‚úÖ **Credibility:** If you can replace Procore, you can build anything  
 ‚úÖ **Not theoretical:** Real GC, real project (in progress)  
 ‚úÖ **Feature superiority:** Not just "cheaper"‚Äîactually better

**Support with Angle \#2 ("Agile Development")** to eliminate "custom sounds risky" objection and show flexibility.

**Close with Angle \#3 ("Feature Superiority")** to prove this isn't just "copying Procore"‚Äîit's building something Procore can't deliver.

**This case study positions you as the GC industry's rebellion against SaaS tyranny. Delta is the hero who said "enough" and took control.**

**And every GC in that room is paying too much for software they don't love. You're offering them the same path Delta took.**

**This is your DBIA mic-drop moment.**
