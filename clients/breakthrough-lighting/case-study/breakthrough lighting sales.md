### **ü•á \#1: "The $10M Pipeline Story" \- Strategic Partnership ROI ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê STRONGEST**

**Headline:** *"$13,500 Investment Generated $10M in Qualified Pipeline for Lighting Distributor"*

**Why This CRUSHES at DBIA:**

* **740:1 pipeline ROI** is extraordinary  
* **Real attribution** from client (not vendor claims)  
* **Actual closed revenue** validates the pipeline ($20K so far)  
* **Shows growth despite adversity** (2025 market challenges)  
* **Positioning as "strategic partner" not vendor** resonates with GCs

**Full Positioning:**

## **"From Vendor to Strategic Partner: How Breakthrough Lighting Generated $10M in Pipeline from $13,500"**

### **The Before State**

Before partnering with systematic BD, Breakthrough Lighting was:

* Operating primarily on referrals and organic growth  
* Using PersistIQ for outreach ($1,500/month, 1,500 emails, 5 solid relationships \= **$300 per relationship**)  
* Sending high volumes with moderate results  
* Missing access to larger GCs and design-build firms  
* No systematic approach to relationship generation

### **The Challenge: Ambitious Growth in Uncertain Times**

Breakthrough Lighting wanted to:

* Access bigger design-build firms and larger GCs  
* Generate 25-30% more new relationships beyond organic/referral baseline  
* Achieve 20% more project opportunities  
* Do this during 2025's market turmoil (tariffs, uncertainty, projects on hold)

### **The Strategic Partnership Approach**

**Instead of just "hiring a vendor," Breakthrough Lighting positioned the engagement as a strategic partnership:**

"I wanted this to be a partnership, right, more than just you guys providing a service. I wanted you guys to participate in our success... We still think of you guys as a strategic partner more than anything else." ‚ÄîJoe Pineda, Breakthrough Lighting

**The Implementation:**

* Multi-channel approach: ConstructConnect, Dodge, General campaigns  
* Project-based targeting for electrical contractors  
* Persona-based targeting for interior designers and architects  
* Systematic follow-up and relationship nurturing  
* Integration with their internal BD team (complementary, not replacement)

**Investment:**

* Actual spend: **$13,500** over 9 months  
* Calculated value: $27,000 (engagement included strategic partnership pricing)  
* Current rate: \~$2,100/month for ongoing services

### **The Results: Growth Against the Odds**

**Pipeline Generation:**

* **$15.67M total opportunities quoted** in 2025 (vs. $13.7M in 2024\)  
* **$2M year-over-year growth** despite market challenges  
* **$10M directly attributed to systematic BD** (Joe's assessment: "I'd be comfortable giving you credit for 10 million of opportunities")  
* **Pipeline ROI: 740:1** ($10M √∑ $13.5K)

**Closed Revenue (To Date):**

* **$20,000 project closed** from ConstructConnect campaign  
* Repeat client secured through systematic outreach  
* Multiple opportunities in active pipeline

**Relationship & Opportunity Growth:**

* **25-30% more new relationships** generated vs. organic baseline  
* **20% more project opportunities** vs. pre-engagement period  
* **Access to bigger players:** "Getting on vendor lists with bigger design-build guys, bigger contractors"  
* **Recurring bid invitations:** "Several jobs from bid lists, some getting repeat requests"

**Efficiency Gains:**

* **"Doing more with less":** Lower email volume (\~1,000/month vs. 1,500 with PersistIQ)  
* **Higher conversion rates:** "The percentages are higher in terms of responses per email"  
* **Better targeting:** "You guys came in, cleaned it up, and were more effective reaching out"  
* **Cost per opportunity: \~$300** (same as PersistIQ but with superior effectiveness)

### **The Market Context: Growth Despite Adversity**

Joe's assessment of 2025 market conditions:

*"2025, we've had the rollercoaster of tariffs and uncertainty and jobs being put on hold... This is not the greatest year to compare year-over-year improvements because of turmoil. The fact that we had such a nice bump anyway speaks volumes of the work that you guys did, the groundwork that we've laid for ourselves."*

**Despite:**

* Tariff uncertainty  
* Projects on hold  
* Market volatility  
* Interest rate concerns

**Breakthrough Lighting still achieved $2M growth in qualified opportunities.**

### **The "Three-Legged Stool" Framework**

Joe positions systematic BD as one of three critical growth drivers:

1. **CRM/HubSpot:** Organizing and tracking all relationships  
2. **NetSuite:** Operational efficiency and financial management  
3. **Systematic BD (Sunrise):** Consistent relationship generation and outreach

*"The legs to the stool are basically, you know, our CRM, it's NetSuite, and you guys, the three-legged stool."*

This integration mindset \= strategic partnership, not vendor relationship.

### **The Attribution Framework (Client's Own Words)**

Joe's honest assessment of attribution:

*"The one thing where it's a challenge, Jason, is that because I had hired business development managers prior to bringing you guys on board, and they were already actively pursuing a lot of these same type of customers, it's hard for me to say at this point which ones came as a result of the outreach and which ones came as a result of the internal outreach."*

**His conclusion:** *"I would venture to say that it was probably a third was because of them, and maybe two-thirds was because of you guys, because you guys sort of came in, cleaned it up, and you were more effective reaching out to some of these people."*

**This means: $10M of $15.67M attributed to systematic BD \= 64% of total pipeline.**

### **Proof Point: The Persistence Example**

Recent success story demonstrates the process:

* Interior designer didn't respond until **3rd outreach attempt**  
* Response led to **Zoom call** (set up by BD team)  
* Zoom call led to **project with drawings and renderings sent**  
* Now in active pipeline with new hire Julia managing

*"That was all you guys, you know, making the contact, because I believe she didn't answer until the third attempt. She finally said, okay, you know, what do you guys have set up? And then that turned into the Zoom, and then the Zoom turned into the opportunity."* ‚ÄîJoe

**Lesson:** Systematic persistence \+ professional follow-up \= opportunities that would have been lost.

### **The "Never Give Up" Philosophy Integration**

Joe's approach to opportunities aligns perfectly with systematic BD:

*"I never give up hope until the customer literally tells you it's done, it's moved on to somebody else. Then, to me, there's always an opportunity... Sometimes a year, two years will go by, and the guys will call me."*

**Systematic BD enables this philosophy at scale:**

* Automated follow-ups over months/years  
* CRM tracking prevents opportunities from slipping  
* Professional persistence without manual overhead

### **ROI Comparison: Previous Vendor vs. Current**

| Metric | PersistIQ (Before) | Systematic BD (Current) |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Monthly Cost** | $1,500 | $1,500 (avg) |
| **Email Volume** | 1,500/month | \~1,000/month |
| **Relationships Generated** | 5/month | Higher rate |
| **Cost Per Relationship** | $300 | \~$300 |
| **Conversion Rate** | Baseline | **Higher** |
| **Quality of Targeting** | Standard | **"More effective"** |
| **Pipeline Generated** | Unknown | **$10M (9 months)** |
| **Strategic Partnership** | ‚ùå No | ‚úÖ **Yes** |
| **Integration with Internal Team** | ‚ùå Minimal | ‚úÖ **Complementary** |

**Key Insight:** Similar cost per relationship, but **superior targeting, higher conversion rates, and strategic integration** \= massively better results.

### **Why This Matters for GCs & Design-Build Firms**

**If you're a specialty contractor, distributor, or subcontractor paying $1,500-$3,000/month for BD services:**

1. Are you generating $10M in pipeline from $13.5K invested?  
2. Are you seeing 25-30% growth in new relationships?  
3. Are you accessing bigger GCs and design-build firms?  
4. Is your BD partner a "strategic partner" or just a vendor?  
5. Are you getting higher conversion rates with less volume (efficiency)?

**Breakthrough Lighting proved that strategic partnership \+ systematic process \= growth even in challenging markets.**

### **ü•à \#2: "The Market Resilience Story" \- Growth Despite Adversity**

**Headline:** *"$2M Pipeline Growth in 2025 Despite Tariff Turmoil & Market Uncertainty"*

**Why This Resonates:**

* **Every GC at DBIA is facing 2025 challenges**  
* Proves the system works even when markets are tough  
* Shows strategic BD as "recession-resistant" growth lever  
* Addresses the "timing" objection ("Is now a good time?")

**Full Positioning:**

## **"How Breakthrough Lighting Grew $2M in Pipeline While the Market Froze"**

### **2025: The Year of Uncertainty**

Every GC and specialty contractor felt the impact:

* Tariff uncertainty halting decisions  
* Projects on hold waiting for clarity  
* Interest rate volatility  
* War concerns affecting supply chains  
* Overall market nervousness

**Joe's assessment:** *"This is not the greatest year to compare year-over-year improvements and things because of turmoil."*

### **Yet Breakthrough Lighting Grew Anyway**

**2024 Performance:** $13.7M in qualified opportunities quoted  
 **2025 Performance (YTD):** $15.67M in qualified opportunities quoted  
 **Net Growth:** **$2M increase (+14.6%)**

**In a down market, that's exceptional.**

### **How Did They Do It?**

**1\. Systematic Outreach Doesn't Stop When Markets Freeze**

While competitors pulled back on BD spending, Breakthrough Lighting maintained consistent outreach:

* \~1,000 contacts/month via email  
* Project-based targeting (ConstructConnect, Dodge)  
* Designer/architect campaigns  
* Persistent follow-up (3+ touchpoints)

**Result:** When the market eventually moves, you're top-of-mind.

**2\. Access to Larger Players \= Bigger Opportunities**

ConstructConnect targeting opened doors to:

* Larger design-build firms  
* Bigger GCs with more stable pipelines  
* Vendor list additions \= recurring bid invitations

**"15-20% more opportunities through ConstructConnect alone"**

**3\. Strategic Partnership \= Adaptive Approach**

Unlike rigid vendor relationships, the strategic partnership allowed:

* Pivoting to higher-quality targets (fewer, better leads)  
* Integrating with internal BD team efforts  
* Complementary (not duplicative) outreach

### **The Resilience Formula**

**Breakthrough Lighting's approach:**

Systematic Process

\+ Strategic Targeting (bigger players)

\+ Persistent Follow-Up

\+ Integration with Internal Team

\= Growth Even When Markets Contract

### **Joe's Reflection on the Results:**

*"The fact that we had such a nice bump anyway, you know, speaks volumes of the work that you guys did, the groundwork that we've laid for ourselves. It's a pretty healthy increase still, you know, in just quoting opportunities, $2 million extra. It's nothing to... that's several more jobs that we didn't get a look at that we didn't even get to sniff the year before."*

### **The 2026 Outlook**

With market stabilization expected:

* Tariff uncertainty resolved  
* War concerns easing  
* Fed rate cuts anticipated  
* Market confidence returning

Joe's prediction: *"To be honest with you, I think 2026 is going to be a better year, not just for us, but for a lot of people in this space."*

**If they grew $2M in a DOWN market, what happens in an UP market with the same systematic approach?**

### **The Lesson for GCs**

**Bad markets separate winners from losers.**

* **Winners:** Maintain BD investment, access bigger players, build pipeline for the recovery  
* **Losers:** Cut BD spending, rely on referrals, miss the rebound

**Breakthrough Lighting positioned themselves as winners by investing in systematic BD during uncertainty.**

### **ü•â \#3: "The Efficiency Story" \- Doing More With Less**

**Headline:** *"Higher Conversion Rates with 33% Less Email Volume: The Breakthrough Lighting Efficiency Gains"*

**Why This Works:**

* **Efficiency \= sustainability** (GCs respect lean operations)  
* **Quality over quantity** narrative  
* **Proves targeting sophistication**  
* **Addresses "spam concerns"**

**Full Positioning:**

## **"We're Doing More With Less": How Breakthrough Lighting Achieved Higher Conversion on Lower Volume**

### **The Conventional Approach: Spray and Pray**

Most outreach services follow the volume playbook:

* Send as many emails as possible  
* Hope some stick  
* Low conversion rates masked by high volume  
* Recipients feel spammed  
* Diminishing returns over time

**Breakthrough Lighting's Previous Vendor (PersistIQ):**

* 1,500 emails/month  
* 5 solid appointments/relationships  
* Cost per relationship: $300  
* **Conversion rate: 0.33%** (5 √∑ 1,500)

### **The Systematic BD Difference: Quality Targeting**

**Current Approach:**

* **\~1,000 emails/month** (33% less volume)  
* Higher number of relationships generated  
* Cost per opportunity: \~$300 (maintained efficiency)  
* **Conversion rate: Significantly higher**

**Joe's Assessment:** *"We're doing more, we're doing more with less, you know, we're being, the percentages are higher in terms of, you know, the responses that we're getting per number of emails that we're sending out, but we're also sending less emails. So the percentage, the effectiveness is higher."*

### **How Systematic BD Achieves Higher Efficiency**

**1\. Project-Based Intelligence**

* Target decision-makers on **active projects with lighting scope**  
* ConstructConnect \+ Dodge data \= qualified targets  
* **15-20% more opportunities** from project-based alone

**2\. Strategic Deduplication**

* Avoid contacting same person about same project across platforms  
* Integration with internal BD team to prevent overlap  
* Cleaner, more professional outreach

**3\. Persistent, Not Annoying**

* 3+ touchpoints over time (not all at once)  
* **Example:** Interior designer didn't respond until 3rd attempt ‚Üí led to Zoom call ‚Üí project with drawings  
* Systematic follow-up \= higher response rates

**4\. Better Targeting \= Better Conversations**

* Reaching the RIGHT people (bigger GCs, design-build firms)  
* Access to decision-makers they "weren't getting access to before"  
* Higher-quality conversations \= higher conversion to opportunities

### **The Efficiency Metrics**

| Metric | PersistIQ | Systematic BD | Improvement |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Email Volume** | 1,500/month | 1,000/month | **\-33%** |
| **Cost Per Relationship** | $300 | \~$300 | **Maintained** |
| **Conversion Rate** | 0.33% | **Higher** | **‚Üë** |
| **Quality of Leads** | Standard | **"More effective"** | **‚Üë** |
| **Access to Larger Players** | ‚ùå Limited | ‚úÖ **Improved** | **‚Üë‚Üë** |
| **Pipeline Generated** | Unknown | **$10M (9 months)** | **‚Üë‚Üë‚Üë** |

### **The Client's Own Words**

**On Effectiveness:** *"You guys sort of came in, cleaned it up, and you were more effective reaching out to some of these people."*

**On Efficiency:** *"So the percentage, the effectiveness is higher, but I would say the cost is probably about, about the same."*

**Translation:** Same cost, better results \= superior ROI.

### **Why This Matters**

**For GCs evaluating BD services:**

‚ùå **Don't ask:** "How many emails do you send?"  
 ‚úÖ **Ask:** "What's your conversion rate and cost per qualified opportunity?"

‚ùå **Don't measure:** Volume of activity  
 ‚úÖ **Measure:** Quality of relationships and pipeline generated

**Breakthrough Lighting proved that less volume \+ better targeting \= more results.**

### **üèÜ \#4: "The Access Elevation Story" \- Moving Upmarket**

**Headline:** *"From Referrals to Vendor Lists with Bigger Design-Build Firms: How ConstructConnect Elevated Market Access"*

**Why This Is Powerful:**

* **Every specialty contractor wants access to bigger players**  
* **Bid list additions \= recurring revenue streams**  
* **Proves systematic BD as "market elevation" tool**  
* **Tangible benefit beyond just "more leads"**

**Full Positioning:**

## **"Getting on the Lists": How Breakthrough Lighting Accessed Bigger Players Through Systematic BD**

### **The Challenge: Market Tier Ceiling**

Like most specialty contractors and distributors, Breakthrough Lighting had a challenge:

* **Strong referral network** in their existing tier  
* **Organic growth** with repeat clients  
* **But limited access** to larger design-build firms and top-tier GCs

**Why?**

* Larger players have established vendor lists  
* Getting on those lists requires either:  
  * Personal relationships (takes years)  
  * Winning a project (catch-22: need to be on list to bid)  
  * Systematic outreach at scale (what Breakthrough did)

### **The ConstructConnect Strategy: Target Active Projects**

**Instead of generic cold outreach, Breakthrough used project-based intelligence:**

* **ConstructConnect:** Database of active projects with detailed scope  
* **Target:** Projects with lighting/electrical scope  
* **Decision-makers:** GCs, design-build firms, project managers on ACTIVE projects

**The pitch:** "We see you're working on \[Project Name\] with \[Scope\]. We specialize in \[Lighting Solution\]. Can we quote?"

### **The Results: Market Elevation**

**Before Systematic BD:**

* Primarily smaller GCs and repeat referrals  
* Limited bid list access  
* Reactive (waiting for inbound)

**After ConstructConnect Targeting:**

* ‚úÖ **Access to bigger design-build firms**  
* ‚úÖ **Vendor list additions** with larger GCs  
* ‚úÖ **Recurring bid invitations** ("they start sending you bids")  
* ‚úÖ **15-20% more project opportunities** through ConstructConnect alone  
* ‚úÖ **Several jobs from bid lists** (ongoing revenue)  
* ‚úÖ **Repeat requests for bids** from same contractors

**Joe's Assessment:** *"We definitely have gotten, as a result of that, into more of the bid vendor lists, you know, because the ConstructConnect has enabled us to access bigger design-build guys, bigger contractors. And so those you get on the vendor list, and then they start sending you bids. So they keep us busy."*

### **The Bid List Multiplier Effect**

**Getting on a vendor list isn't a one-time win‚Äîit's a recurring revenue stream:**

1. **Initial outreach** ‚Üí Relationship established  
2. **Quote on first project** ‚Üí Prove capability  
3. **Added to vendor list** ‚Üí Recurring access  
4. **Future bid invitations** ‚Üí $0 marginal acquisition cost  
5. **Repeat requests** ‚Üí Long-term relationship

**Joe confirms this pattern:** *"We have definitely gotten some, in some cases, you know, repeat requests for bids for some of these."*

### **The Economics of Market Elevation**

**Investment in ConstructConnect targeting:**

* Part of overall $13,500 (9 months)  
* Generated 15-20% lift in project opportunities  
* Multiple bid list additions

**Value of ONE bid list addition:**

* Average project: $50K-$200K+ (lighting/electrical)  
* Assume 1 bid invitation per quarter \= 4/year  
* Assume 25% win rate \= 1 project/year  
* Assume $100K average project \= **$100K annual value**  
* **From ONE bid list addition**

**If ConstructConnect generated 5 bid list additions:**

* 5 √ó $100K \= **$500K potential annual recurring revenue**  
* From a portion of the $13.5K total investment

### **Why Bigger Players Matter**

**It's not just about MORE opportunities‚Äîit's about BETTER opportunities:**

* Larger project values  
* More stable pipelines  
* Professional processes  
* Repeat business potential  
* Credibility signal (reference for other large GCs)

**Joe's perspective on the market:** *"We're getting access to people that we weren't getting access to before, thanks to that campaign."*

### **The Systematic Approach**

**This didn't happen by accident:**

1. **Target active projects** (not random companies)  
2. **Reach decision-makers** on those specific projects  
3. **Relevant, timely outreach** (not generic pitches)  
4. **Persistent follow-up** (3+ touchpoints)  
5. **Professional execution** (increases response rate)

**Result:** Access to market tier that was previously closed.

### **The Lesson for Specialty Contractors**

**If you're stuck in your current market tier:**

‚ùå **Don't:** Wait for referrals to move you upmarket  
 ‚úÖ **Do:** Systematically target active projects with larger players

‚ùå **Don't:** Send generic "we're great" cold emails  
 ‚úÖ **Do:** Reference specific projects with relevant scope

‚ùå **Don't:** Give up after 1-2 attempts  
 ‚úÖ **Do:** Persist through 3+ touchpoints (as Breakthrough did)

**Breakthrough Lighting proved that systematic BD is a market elevation tool, not just a lead generation service.**

### **üéØ \#5: "The Strategic Partnership Story" \- Beyond Vendor Relationships**

**Headline:** *"The Three-Legged Stool: How Breakthrough Lighting Integrated Systematic BD into Their Growth Strategy"*

**Why This Matters:**

* **Differentiates from transactional vendor relationships**  
* **Shows integration, not isolation**  
* **Demonstrates long-term thinking**  
* **Resonates with strategic GCs**

**Full Positioning:**

## **"More Than Just a Service": How Breakthrough Lighting Built a Strategic Partnership for Growth**

### **The Vendor Trap**

Most GCs treat BD services like this:

* Hire a vendor  
* Give them parameters  
* Expect results  
* Blame them when results don't meet expectations  
* Move to next vendor

**Result:** Revolving door of BD services, inconsistent results, no strategic integration.

### **The Strategic Partnership Alternative**

**Joe's approach from day one:**

*"I told you before from the very beginning, I wanted this to be a partnership, right, more than just you guys providing a service. And I also wanted you guys to participate in our success, you know, by giving you a piece of the pie, right? And that's still my mentality, you know. We still think of you guys as a strategic partner more than anything else."*

**What does this mean in practice?**

**1\. Gave Access to ConstructConnect Database**

* Shared their $X,000/year ConstructConnect subscription  
* Allowed Sunrise to use it for other clients  
* Mutual value creation (not just one-way extraction)

**2\. Integration with Internal BD Team**

* Didn't replace Brett and Richard (internal BD managers)  
* **Complementary approach:** Systematic outreach PLUS internal relationship building  
* Attribution shared: 2/3 Sunrise, 1/3 internal (Joe's honest assessment)  
* *"You guys sort of came in, cleaned it up, and you were more effective reaching out"*

**3\. "Three-Legged Stool" Framework**

Joe views growth infrastructure as three interdependent components:

* **Leg 1: CRM/HubSpot** ‚Üí Organize and track all relationships  
* **Leg 2: NetSuite** ‚Üí Operational efficiency, proposals, invoicing, financial management  
* **Leg 3: Systematic BD (Sunrise)** ‚Üí Consistent relationship generation, outreach, follow-up

*"The legs to the stool are basically, you know, our CRM, it's NetSuite, and you guys, the three-legged stool."*

**Not a vendor relationship. A strategic growth pillar.**

**4\. Long-Term Thinking**

Despite 2025 market challenges:

* Maintained investment in systematic BD  
* Didn't cut spending when markets froze  
* Focused on 2026 positioning

*"In 2026, we're going to maybe add a few more components from you guys' side... I want to go full throttle, you know, with everything."*

### **The Results of Strategic Partnership**

**Compared to Previous Vendor (PersistIQ):**

| Aspect | PersistIQ (Vendor) | Systematic BD (Partner) |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Relationship Type** | Transactional | Strategic |
| **Integration** | Isolated | Integrated with team |
| **Flexibility** | Rigid | Adaptive |
| **Mutual Value** | One-way | Two-way (ConstructConnect access) |
| **Long-term Alignment** | ‚ùå No | ‚úÖ **Yes** |
| **Results** | 5 relationships/month | **$10M pipeline, 25-30% growth** |

### **The "Never Give Up" Philosophy Alignment**

Joe's core belief: *"I never give up hope until the customer literally tells you it's done, it's moved on to somebody else. Then, to me, there's always an opportunity, you know. So, I appreciate you following up on that. And the day that comes through. It's going to be awesome."*

**Systematic BD enables this philosophy at scale:**

* Automated follow-ups over months/years  
* CRM integration prevents opportunities from slipping  
* Professional persistence without manual overhead  
* **Example:** Interior designer didn't respond until 3rd attempt ‚Üí now in pipeline

### **The Strategic Value Beyond Leads**

**What Breakthrough gets from strategic partnership:**

1. **Consistent pipeline generation** ($10M and growing)  
2. **Market elevation** (access to bigger players)  
3. **Operational integration** (works WITH internal team, not against)  
4. **Long-term thinking** (investment in 2026 growth during 2025 uncertainty)  
5. **Mutual value creation** (ConstructConnect access sharing)  
6. **Flexibility and adaptation** (not locked into rigid vendor contract)

### **The Testimonial That Says It All**

*"Whatever you need from me in terms of a testimony, Jason, I'd be more than happy, man, because, you know, you guys have helped us out. And I know, you know, you've made some concessions along the way, which we have really appreciated. We've kind of helped each other as well by giving you access to the ConstructConnect database and all that... We still think of you guys as a strategic partner more than anything else."* ‚ÄîJoe Pineda

### **The Lesson for GCs**

**Ask yourself:**

* Is your BD service a **vendor** you manage, or a **partner** you collaborate with?  
* Does your BD integrate with your team, or work in isolation?  
* Are you thinking transactionally (quarterly results) or strategically (multi-year growth)?  
* Is there mutual value creation, or just one-way extraction?

**Breakthrough Lighting chose strategic partnership‚Äîand generated $10M in pipeline from $13.5K investment as a result.**

## **TESTIMONIAL \- CLIENT'S OWN WORDS**

*"I'd be comfortable giving you credit for 10 million of opportunities... The fact that we had such a nice bump anyway, you know, speaks volumes of the work that you guys did, the groundwork that we've laid for ourselves. It's a pretty healthy increase still, you know, in just quoting opportunities, $2 million extra. It's nothing to... that's several more jobs that we didn't get a look at that we didn't even get to sniff the year before."*

*"We're doing more, we're doing more with less, you know, we're being, the percentages are higher in terms of, you know, the responses that we're getting per number of emails that we're sending out, but we're also sending less emails."*

*"You guys sort of came in, cleaned it up, and you were more effective reaching out to some of these people."*

*"We're getting access to people that we weren't getting access to before, thanks to that campaign."*

*"Whatever you need from me in terms of a testimony, Jason, I'd be more than happy, man, because, you know, you guys have helped us out... We still think of you guys as a strategic partner more than anything else."*

## **RECOMMENDED DBIA POSITIONING:**

**Lead with Angle \#1 ("The $10M Pipeline Story")** because:

‚úÖ **Client-attributed results** (not vendor claims)  
 ‚úÖ **740:1 pipeline ROI** is extraordinary  
 ‚úÖ **$20K closed revenue** validates the pipeline  
 ‚úÖ **Strategic partnership narrative** resonates with sophisticated GCs  
 ‚úÖ **Shows growth despite adversity** (2025 challenges)  
 ‚úÖ **Real attribution framework** (honest about internal BD team contribution)

**Support with Angle \#4 ("The Access Elevation Story")** to emphasize the **market tier advancement** benefit (bid lists, bigger players, recurring revenue).

**Close with Angle \#2 ("The Market Resilience Story")** to address timing concerns and show this works **even in down markets**.

---

## **CRITICAL TALKING POINTS FOR DBIA:**

1. **"Joe gave us credit for $10M of $15.67M in pipeline‚Äîand he had an internal BD team. That's how effective systematic BD is."**

2. **"They grew $2M year-over-year in 2025 despite tariffs, market uncertainty, and projects on hold. Imagine the results in a good market."**

3. **"Same cost per opportunity as their previous vendor ($300), but with higher conversion rates and access to bigger players. Quality over quantity."**

4. **"Getting on bid lists \= recurring revenue streams. One ConstructConnect campaign opened doors to multiple vendor lists with top-tier GCs."**

5. **"Joe calls it the 'three-legged stool': CRM \+ Operations \+ Systematic BD. Not a vendor‚Äîa strategic growth pillar."**

---

**This reworked case study is now dramatically stronger with real client attribution, specific growth metrics, market context, and testimonials. The $10M pipeline from $13.5K investment is a blockbuster headline, and the 25-30% relationship growth plus 20% opportunity increase are quantified proof points that will resonate at DBIA.**
