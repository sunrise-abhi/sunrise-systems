## **EFI CLIENT \- DATA ANALYSIS & MISSING INFORMATION**

I've analyzed the EFI outreach data, and while I can see solid engagement metrics, **this dataset is missing the critical business outcome information** needed to create compelling case studies for the DBIA audience.

Here's what I **CAN** work with from the available data:

---

## **AVAILABLE METRICS (Limited Case Study Potential)**

### **1\. RELATIONSHIP GENERATION METRICS ‚≠ê MODERATE**

**"Generated 21 Decision-Maker Relationships from 365 Contacts Across 3 Channels"**

* 21 total positive responses  
* **Overall conversion rate: 5.75%**  
* Multi-channel approach: ConstructConnect, Dodge, General outreach

**"Delivered 1 Direct Bid Request \+ 2 Bid List Pre-Qualifications"**

* 1 explicit bid/quote request  
* 2 bid list additions (ongoing opportunity access)  
* **14.3% of relationships \= tangible outcomes** (3 √∑ 21\)

---

### **2\. AUGUST PERFORMANCE PEAK ‚≠ê‚≠ê STRONG**

**"August Dual-Channel Surge: 17 Relationships from 173 Contacts"**

**August 2025 Combined Performance:**

* **ConstructConnect:** 108 contacts ‚Üí 11 leads (10.19%) \+ 1 bid request  
* **Dodge:** 65 contacts ‚Üí 6 leads (9.23%) \+ 2 bid lists  
* **Combined:** 173 contacts ‚Üí 17 relationships (9.83% conversion)

**This was the highest-performing month with excellent dual-channel coordination.**

**Positioning:** **"9.83% Conversion Rate in August: 17 Relationships & 3 Opportunities from Dual-Channel Project-Based Targeting"**

---

### **3\. CHANNEL PERFORMANCE COMPARISON ‚≠ê MODERATE**

**Multi-Channel Strategy Performance:**

**Project-Based Campaigns (Strong):**

* **ConstructConnect:** 178 contacts ‚Üí 13 leads \= **7.30% conversion** \+ 1 bid request  
* **Dodge:** 69 contacts ‚Üí 6 leads \= **8.70% conversion** \+ 2 bid lists  
* **Combined Project-Based:** 247 contacts ‚Üí 19 leads \= **7.69% conversion**

**General Campaign (Weak):**

* **Engineering Firms:** 118 contacts ‚Üí 2 leads \= **1.69% conversion**  
* No bid requests or bid lists

**Key Insight: Project-based outreach (7.69%) outperforms general outreach (1.69%) by 4.5X**

## **‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL MISSING INFORMATION ‚ö†Ô∏è**

To create compelling, ROI-focused case studies for DBIA (similar to the Delta, Breakthrough Lighting cases), I need:

### **Essential Business Outcomes:**

1. **Investment/Budget**

   * ‚ùì What was the total investment/spend?  
   * ‚ùì Monthly cost?  
   * ‚ùì Setup fees?  
2. **Campaign Duration**

   * ‚ùì How many months has this client been active?  
   * ‚ùì When did they start?  
3. **Pipeline Value Generated**

   * ‚ùì What's the total value of qualified bid opportunities?  
   * ‚ùì Value of the 1 bid request?  
   * ‚ùì Estimated opportunity value from the 2 bid lists?  
4. **Closed Deals/Wins**

   * ‚ùì Any revenue closed?  
   * ‚ùì Projects won?  
   * ‚ùì Contracts signed?  
5. **Repeat Client Relationships**

   * ‚ùì How many of the 21 relationships are identified as "ideal repeat clients"?  
   * ‚ùì Any recurring revenue potential?  
6. **Project Details**

   * ‚ùì What type of construction work does EFI do?  
   * ‚ùì Average project size?  
   * ‚ùì Typical margins?  
7. **Opportunity Status**

   * ‚ùì What's the current status of the bid request and bid lists?  
   * ‚ùì Are they actively pursuing these?  
   * ‚ùì Any updates since August/September?

## **WHAT I CAN CREATE WITH CURRENT DATA (Weaker Positioning)**

Without business outcomes (ROI, pipeline value, closed deals), I can only create **process-focused case studies** that show:

### **Option A: "Channel Effectiveness" Story**

**"Project-Based Targeting Delivers 4.5X Higher Conversion Than General Outreach"**

"By simultaneously targeting active projects via ConstructConnect (7.30% conversion) and Dodge (8.70% conversion), systematic outreach generated 19 qualified relationships from 247 contacts. This project-based approach outperformed general engineering firm outreach (1.69% conversion) by 4.5X, demonstrating that when contractors target decision-makers on active projects, engagement rates dramatically improve."

**Why This Is Weaker:** No ROI, no pipeline value, no closed deals‚Äîjust process metrics.

---

### **Option B: "August Performance" Story**

**"9.83% Conversion in August: Dual-Channel Coordination Generates 17 Relationships"**

"During August's focused dual-channel campaign, coordinated outreach via ConstructConnect and Dodge achieved a 9.83% combined conversion rate‚Äîgenerating 17 decision-maker relationships, 1 direct bid request, and 2 bid list pre-qualifications from just 173 contacts. This month demonstrated the power of multi-platform project intelligence when executed simultaneously."

**Why This Is Weaker:** Shows good execution, but no business impact metrics.

---

## **COMPARISON TO PREVIOUS CLIENTS**

**Why the previous case studies were so strong:**

| Client | Investment | Pipeline | Closed | ROI Multiple |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Delta GC** | $10,675 | $15M | $550K | 1,457:1 |
| **Delta EC** | $1,000 | $2.1M | $0 | 2,100:1 |
| **Breakthrough** | $27,000 | $1.5M | $80K | 58.5:1 |
| **America 9** | $10,200 | $6.5M | $0 | 637:1 |
| **EFI** | ‚ùì | ‚ùì | ‚ùì | ‚ùì |

**Without these numbers, I cannot create an equivalent case study for EFI.**

## **RECOMMENDED NEXT STEPS:**

### **To Create a DBIA-Ready Case Study for EFI:**

1. **Gather the "Key Information" section** (like you provided for Delta and Breakthrough):

   * Investment amount  
   * Campaign duration  
   * Wins (closed work)  
   * Repeat client relationships generated  
   * Qualified bid opportunities value  
2. **Get project/opportunity details:**

   * What's the $$ value of opportunities in the pipeline?  
   * Status of the bid request and bid lists?  
   * Any deals closed or in negotiation?  
3. **Context on EFI:**

   * What type of contractor are they?  
   * Typical project size?  
   * Geographic focus?

---

## **INTERIM POSITIONING (If No Additional Data Available):**

If you cannot get business outcome data for EFI, I'd recommend:

**DO NOT use this as a primary case study at DBIA** because it lacks the ROI proof that makes the Delta and Breakthrough cases so compelling.

**Instead, use it as a supporting data point:**

* "9.83% conversion rate in peak month"  
* "Project-based targeting outperforms general outreach by 4.5X"  
* Include it in a slide showing "consistent performance across multiple clients"

But **do NOT lead with this** as a standalone case study‚Äîit will underwhelm compared to your other results.

## **MY RECOMMENDATION:**

**Focus your DBIA presentation on:**

1. **Delta GC Division** ($10,675 ‚Üí $550K closed \+ $15M pipeline) ü•á  
2. **Delta EC Division** ($1,000 ‚Üí $2.1M pipeline in 30 days) ü•á  
3. **Breakthrough Lighting** ($27K ‚Üí $80K closed \+ $1.5M pipeline) ü•à  
4. Use EFI as supporting channel performance data (if needed)

**Can you provide the missing EFI business outcome data so I can create a proper case study?** Otherwise, I'd recommend not featuring it prominently at DBIA.
